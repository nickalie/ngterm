# Hard rules (paste verbatim into every subagent prompt and into the plan)

The block between the markers is pasted unchanged into each subagent prompt this skill sends and into the plan's
"Safety rules" section, so they reach the plan's task subagents too. The rules have one source here; when they
change, `CLAUDE.md` > "Never touch the user's running ngterm" changes first and this file follows it.

<!-- BEGIN HARD RULES -->
HARD RULES (ngterm upstream sync). They hold for every command you run, no matter what the task says:

1. Never touch the user's running ngterm. This session usually runs inside a pane of an installed ngterm, whose
   `NGTERM_*` variables point at it, or of an agterm, whose `AGTERM_*` variables (and `ZMX_*`, where it runs its
   sessions on zmx) do.
   - Strip them before launching anything: `env -u NGTERM_SESSION_ID ...` is not enough, use
     `env $(env | grep -oE '^(NGTERM|AGTERM|ZMX)_[A-Z0-9_]*' | sed 's/^/-u /') <command>`, or `scripts/run-gpui-dev.sh`, or
     the suite's runners, which strip them themselves.
   - Every `ngtermctl` call gets an explicit `--socket <dev instance socket>`, written after the subcommand name
     (`ngtermctl tree --socket /tmp/ngterm-dev-.../state/ngterm.sock`). Without it the CLI resolves
     `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ngterm/ngterm.sock`, the live instance's; `NGTERM_CONTROL_SOCKET` is ignored by ngtermctl.
   - A dev instance gets a private state dir, so its live-session namespace (`/tmp/ngterm-live-<FNV-1a 64 of the
     state dir>`) and the one session server serving it (`ngterm-session server <that dir>`) are private too. Reap
     only through that server (`NGTERM_LIVE_DIR=<that dir> ngterm-session kill --force <name>...`) or processes
     carrying that instance's `NGTERM_LIVE_DIR`. Never `pkill ngterm-session` or `pkill zmx`, never `killall`, never
     run `ngterm-session` without that instance's `NGTERM_LIVE_DIR`.
   - GUI runs headless only: the suite's private weston and dbus (`conformance/tools/run-linux.sh`), or
     `GDK_BACKEND=x11 xvfb-run -a dbus-run-session cargo test --workspace`, which gives the tests a display and a
     session bus of their own. Never a window on the user's desktop, never a connection to its session bus or
     compositor. GPUI renders through Vulkan: a headless app instance renders on Mesa's lavapipe alone
     (`scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh`), never on the machine's GPU, and on Wayland it needs a seat, which only a recent
     headless weston gives (`scripts/build-weston.sh`). A compositor started by hand copies the setup in
     `conformance/agterm_conformance/impls/base.py`.
   - While an installed ngterm runs, launch a checkout's build only through `scripts/run-gpui-dev.sh` or the suite: a plain launch is forwarded to the running instance through the shared
     app id, or both write one `windows.json`.
   - If a command did reach the live instance, stop and report exactly what changed; do not undo it through the
     live socket yourself.
2. `.upstream/agterm` is read-only: read it, `git diff`/`git show`/`git log` in it, never edit, commit, reset or
   clean there. The only write allowed is the sync's own fetch and checkout of the new tag.
3. Never push, never create tags or releases, never open PRs. Commits stay local.
4. Never edit a completed plan in `docs/plans/completed/`, and never rewrite another open plan in `docs/plans/`.
5. Anything that runs longer than about 30 seconds (cargo build/test/clippy, zig builds, `run-linux.sh`,
   downloads) runs with `run_in_background: true`; wait for its completion notification instead of sleeping or
   polling, and leave nothing running when you report back.
6. Tools and dependencies: only popular, widely used, maintained ones; lead with the standard choice.
