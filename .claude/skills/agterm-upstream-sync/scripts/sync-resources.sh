#
# Each copy gets upstream's own diff, applied with `git apply --directory`, so the Linux glue a copy carries (the
# Linux chords in ghostty-defaults.conf) survives wherever upstream did not touch the same lines. Nothing is applied partially: a diff that does not apply cleanly
# is left out whole, saved under --patches DIR (default: a temp dir, printed, and removed again when no conflict
# was saved in it), and reported as `conflict` for a plan task to merge by hand. --check applies nothing.
#
# A copy listed in PATCHED is instead upstream's NEW tree with the repository's own patches reapplied in order (the
# agent-status package's Linux glue and ngterm names, build/patches/agent-status; the bundled skill's `live` and
# ngterm names, build/patches/skill-ngterm), so it carries nothing else, its renamed files included: a patch that no longer
# applies is a `conflict` naming it, to be refreshed by hand. `--check TAG TAG` (the pinned tag twice) verifies that
# such a copy still equals the pinned upstream tree plus its patches: `unchanged` when it does, `would-apply` when not.
#
# Output, one line per copy: `<status> <upstream path> -> <copy>` with status unchanged | applied | would-apply |
# already-applied | conflict; then `unmapped` for every agterm/Resources entry or LICENSE change no mapping covers.
