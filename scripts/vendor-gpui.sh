# Vendor the GPUI crates ngterm patches (docs/plans/20261014-gpui-frontend.md, Technical Details > GPUI patches) into
# vendor/<crate> with build/patches/<crate> applied, for the workspace's [patch.crates-io]:
#   gpui-pre       the `ExternalSurface` payload of `PaintSurface` on Linux and `Window::paint_external_surface`, the
#                  dmabuf import capabilities of the GPU GPUI renders with (0001); `TextSystem::font_metrics`, a face's
#                  metrics as its font declares them (0002); `Window::paint_alpha_mask`, a coverage mask the caller
#                  rasterized, tinted like a glyph (0003); `TextSystem::font_strikeout`, a face's OS/2 strikeout
#                  metrics (0004)
#   gpui-pre-wgpu  the renderer's side of external surfaces (dmabufs imported through wgpu-hal Vulkan, acquired from
#                  the foreign queue family and copied on the GPU into a texture of its own; CPU pixels uploaded by
#                  damaged rectangles) and the Vulkan device opened with VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier and
#                  VK_EXT_queue_family_foreign, which wgpu does not enable itself (0001); the cosmic-text system's
#                  strikeout metrics read from the face's OS/2 table (0002)
#   gpui-pre-linux the native key behind each key event GPUI dispatches on Wayland and X11 (its XKB keycode, layout
#                  character and modifiers), which GPUI's `Keystroke` drops, for the terminal's physical-key bindings
#                  and the Kitty keyboard protocol, and a text/html clipboard offer beside or instead of the text
#                  (Task 14 of the plan, 0001); the Wayland displays' logical geometry from xdg-output, right at a
#                  fractional scale (Task 24, 0002); an X11 window's minimized and maximized state read back, and KWin's
#                  blur behind a blurred X11 window (Task 33, 0003); a new keymap reported as a keyboard layout
#                  change on X11 and Wayland even when the effective layout keeps its name, so a changed layout list
#                  reaches `on_keyboard_layout_change` (Task 29 of the upstream v0.38.1 sync, 0004)
#
# Each source is the crates.io archive of GPUI_VERSION, verified against SHA256 below: the release's crates.io
# checksum (the `cksum` of its version's line in the crates.io index, https://index.crates.io/gp/ui/<crate>, also what
# a Cargo.lock without the [patch.crates-io] entries records). It is unpacked verbatim apart from its Cargo.lock (which
# pins nothing for a dependency) and, for gpui-pre, its examples/ directory (5 MB of demo programs and images no build
# of ours compiles; Cargo reads a dependency's [[example]] entries without looking for their files), then patched.
# Bump GPUI_VERSION and the sums together with gpui-kit's `gpui-pre` pin, run this, and check that the patches still
# apply.
#
# Usage: scripts/vendor-gpui.sh           (re)create vendor/gpui-pre, vendor/gpui-pre-wgpu and vendor/gpui-pre-linux
#        scripts/vendor-gpui.sh --check   rebuild into a scratch dir and fail if a vendored crate differs
#        scripts/vendor-gpui.sh --diff    regenerate the last patch of each crate, build/patches/<crate>/NNNN-*.patch,
#                                         as the vendored tree against the crate with the earlier patches applied
#                                         (after editing vendor/; the patch's leading description is kept). A new
#                                         patch starts as a file holding only its description, numbered after the
#                                         others; edits that belong to an earlier patch go there by hand.
