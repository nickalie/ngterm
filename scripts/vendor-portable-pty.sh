# Vendor portable-pty (ngterm-pty's PTY and child: openpty on Unix, ConPTY on Windows) into vendor/portable-pty with
# build/patches/portable-pty applied, for the workspace's [patch.crates-io]. Each file's leading description says why
# it exists, where it came from and when it can go:
#   0001 the ConPTY functions of the already loaded kernel32 only, never a bare conpty.dll through the DLL search path
#        (herdr's 0001 reduced: herdr also loads a hash-checked app-local conpty.dll, which ngterm does not ship)
#   0002 malformed Windows environments rejected (herdr's 0003)
#   0003 directories skipped when resolving a program on PATH (herdr's 0004)
#   0004 a child spawned straight into a job object (PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST), so no descendant escapes it
#   0005 a ConPTY master's handles exported, and a master rebuilt from handles another process handed over (the
#        session server's update handoff)
#   0006 a raw command-line tail, appended without ArgvQuote escaping (herdr's 0002): a pane's command line runs as
#        cmd.exe's command text
#   0007 a failed openpty's io::Error kept, so ngterm-pty reads its errno (the macOS ptmx clone race's retry)
#
# The source is the crates.io archive of PORTABLE_PTY_VERSION, verified against PORTABLE_PTY_SHA256 (the checksum
# Cargo.lock records for it), unpacked verbatim apart from its Cargo.lock (which pins nothing for a dependency), then
# patched. Bump both constants together with the workspace's portable-pty requirement, run this, and check that the
# patches still apply.
#
# Usage: scripts/vendor-portable-pty.sh           (re)create vendor/portable-pty
#        scripts/vendor-portable-pty.sh --check   rebuild into a scratch dir and fail if vendor/portable-pty differs
#        scripts/vendor-portable-pty.sh --diff    regenerate the last patch, build/patches/portable-pty/NNNN-*.patch, as
#                                                 the vendored tree against the crate with the earlier patches applied
#                                                 (after editing vendor/; the patch's leading description is kept). A
#                                                 new patch starts as a file holding only its description, numbered
#                                                 after the others; edits that belong to an earlier patch go there by
#                                                 hand.
