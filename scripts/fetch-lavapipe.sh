# Find Mesa's lavapipe (software Vulkan) for the GPUI build's headless runs and print its ICD manifest, the file
# VK_DRIVER_FILES names. The GPUI build renders through Vulkan; in the conformance harness and ngterm-gpui's process
# tests it must render on lavapipe and on nothing else, never on the machine's GPU driver, so there is no fallback: no
# lavapipe is an error naming this script.
#
# Where it comes from, first match wins:
#   1. NGTERM_LAVAPIPE_ICD, an ICD manifest given by hand (it must exist);
#   2. the distribution's package, the documented source wherever one is installable (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora
#      `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, Arch `vulkan-swrast`; CI installs Ubuntu's): `lvp_icd.<arch>.json` or `lvp_icd.json` in
#      the Vulkan loader's ICD directories (NGTERM_VULKAN_ICD_DIRS, colon-separated, replaces the list, for tests);
#   3. a rootless machine with an Arch-compatible userland: the pinned Arch `vulkan-swrast` package
#      (LAVAPIPE_ARCH_PACKAGE_URL of build/pins.env), verified against its pinned sha256 and unpacked into the vendored
#      prefix ${NGTERM_VENDOR:-~/.cache/ngterm/vendor}/lavapipe-<key>/ (no root), with an ICD manifest naming the
#      driver by absolute path. The key hashes the LAVAPIPE_ pins and the host arch only. The driver links the host's
#      libLLVM and glibc: the unpack refuses a host where any of its libraries does not resolve.
#
# Usage: scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh                 print the ICD, unpacking the vendored prefix when that is the source
#                                                  and it is not complete yet
#        scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh --print-icd     print the ICD without fetching anything; exit 1 when none is there
#        scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh --print-prefix  print the vendored prefix path only
#        scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh --verify        exit 0 when the vendored prefix is complete, 1 otherwise
