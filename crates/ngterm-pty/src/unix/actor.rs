//! The PTY actor on Unix: one thread polls the non-blocking master and a wake pipe, hands each batch of output to
//! the read callback, writes the outbox as the master takes it, and serves the handoff's requests between rounds.

//! herdr: `src/pty/actor/unix.rs` (`PtyIoActor`, `PtyIoActorHandle`, `PtyIoActorRunner`: the poll loop, the wake
//! after each queued command, the handoff's begin, duplicate, rollback and release, the foreground process group,

//! reads batched up to `READ_BATCH` per callback; a quiesced actor writes nothing either; resizes on the caller's
//! thread in place of herdr's latest-wins request, so a resize reaches the child before later input; input
