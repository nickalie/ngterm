//! The PTY actor's platform-neutral half: what it is started with, the handle its users hold, and the outbox of
//! bytes waiting for the child. The IO itself is per OS (`unix/actor.rs`: one thread polling the master and a wake
//! pipe; `windows/actor.rs`: a reader and a writer thread on the pseudoconsole's pipes).
//!
//! herdr: `src/pty/actor.rs` and `src/pty/actor/unix.rs` (`PtyIoActorConfig`, `PtyReadResult`, `PtyIoActorHandle`,
//! its user-write gate and its terminal-response ordering) at `HERDR_REV` (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the
//! Apache License 2.0, modified:
//! - std threads and channels in place of tokio; herdr's input submissions (a prompt, a delay, then Enter) are not
//!   ported;
//! - input and replies share one outbox, bounded in bytes as `ngterm-term`'s pane queue is (a chunk that does not fit
//!   beside what is queued is refused, so the frontend sees backpressure; the terminal's replies are always taken, up
//!   to a hard cap), in place of herdr's bounded command channel;
//! - quiesced means the actor neither reads nor writes, on Windows too, and the exit callback says why the actor
//!   stopped.
