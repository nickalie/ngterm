//! The agent-status hooks installer (upstream's `AgentHooksInstaller.swift`): the bundled package into
//! `~/.config/ngterm/agent-status` with the bundled `ngtermctl` baked into its wrappers, a marker-guarded `source` line
//! in `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc` and (when fish is set up) `config.fish`, the Claude Code hooks merged into
//! `~/.claude/settings.json`, the Codex hooks into `~/.codex/config.toml`, and, where each agent is set up, Pi's
//! extension and `OpenCode`'s plugin. The Claude Code hooks include the restore adapter's (an ngterm extension:
//! [`config::RESTORE_WRAPPER_NAME`]); Codex gets none. Claude and Codex configs get a `.bak` first; every rewrite keeps
//! a symlinked file's link and its target's mode. Idempotent: a second run refreshes the baked path and changes
//! nothing else. An install over one in [`legacy_script_dir`] (this build's before it had its own) moves every
//! reference onto the new directory instead of adding a second set.
//!
//! [`plan`] reads the home and decides every step (what each agent has, what is current, what is the user's) without
//! writing; [`apply`] carries the plan out and reports upstream's outcomes.
//!
//! On Windows every agent keeps its config under the user's profile at the same relative paths (`%USERPROFILE%`'s
//! `.claude`, `.codex`, `.pi\agent`, `.config\opencode`), and the package goes to the same `.config\ngterm\agent-status`
//! that the Pi extension and the `OpenCode` plugins name, paths written with forward slashes ([`shell_path`]). Claude
//! Code runs a hook's command in Git Bash there, or in PowerShell without it, so its hooks call the package's
//! PowerShell forms through `powershell.exe`, a command line both shells read alike ([`config::HookForm`]); the Pi
//! extension and the `OpenCode` plugins start the PowerShell wrapper the same way. Codex runs a hook through
//! `cmd.exe`, so its block adds each hook's `command_windows`, the POSIX adapter under Git Bash
//! ([`config::WINDOWS_BASH`]). Nothing is linked, and no mode is set or kept ([`files`]).
