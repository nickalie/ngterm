//! Logging: `tracing` to stderr and to [`LOG_FILE_NAME`] in the state directory, both at the level from
//! [`LOG_ENV`] (default `info`).
//!
//! stderr stays: the conformance harness captures it as the instance log `conformance/tools/ghostty_probe.py`
//! reads. The file follows upstream's own log under the state directory, the session host's `session-host.log`
//! (`SessionHost.paths` in `agtermCore/Sources/agtermCore/SessionHost.swift`), which the host opens append-only,
//! owner-only and without following a symlink (`Host.redirectStandardIO` in
//! `agtermCore/Sources/SessionHostRuntime/Host.swift`) and never rotates; upstream's app itself logs to the unified
//! log. Appending matters here too: a second `ngterm` launch runs this before
//! `GApplication` forwards it to the running instance, so a truncation at startup would wipe the live instance's log.
//! The one addition is a bound: a file past [`ROTATE_BYTES`] at startup moves to [`ROTATED_FILE_NAME`], replacing
//! the previous one. That too must spare a running instance, whose log may have grown past the bound since its own
//! startup: the process that logs to the file holds an exclusive `flock` on it for its lifetime, and a launch that
//! finds it held never rotates, nor does one whose file another launch rotated away after it was opened. A file
//! that cannot be opened leaves logging on stderr alone, with a warning there.
//!
//! The OS forms ([`platform`]): on Unix the file is opened `O_NOFOLLOW` and `0600`, the lock is `flock` over the
//! whole file and the file's identity at its path is its device and inode. On Windows a file lock is mandatory, so a
//! whole-file lock would refuse the second launch's appends: the instance lock is one byte far past any length the log
//! reaches (`LockFileEx`), which no write touches; the file is opened shared for reading, writing and renaming (the
//! rotation renames it while other launches hold it) with `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`, and refused when what opened
//! is a reparse point (a symlink, or a mount point), so no link is followed; the state directory under
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is the user's alone by its inherited ACL, which stands in for the mode; the identity is the volume
//! serial number and file index (`GetFileInformationByHandle`).
