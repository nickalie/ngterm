//! `ngtermctl terminfo install` (`agtermctlKit/TerminfoCommands.swift`, `agtermCore/TerminfoInstall.swift`): installs

//! decompiled into source here, as upstream's local `infocmp -x` dumps it ([`source`]: Windows has no `infocmp`), and
//! the remote `tic` compiles it into that account's `~/.terminfo`. Local-only: it never opens the control socket, so
