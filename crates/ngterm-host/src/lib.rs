//! Host seams of ngterm: what the platform-neutral core and control server need from a frontend.

//! - [`MainLoop`]: posts work to the thread that owns the app state (the GPUI main thread in `ngterm-gpui`).
//! - [`Surface`]: one live terminal (libghostty-vt in the frontend's terminal element), owned on the main thread.
//! - [`SessionHost`]: the daemons that keep live sessions alive across app restarts (the session server's).
//! - [`ProcessLauncher`]: starts helper processes (overlay programs, hooks, custom commands).
//! - [`ShellCommand`]: the shell a user's command line runs through, per OS ([`command_line`]).
//! - [`ProcessTable`]: reads the process table (a pane's foreground program for the tree and the restore capture).
//!
//! In-memory fakes of each live in [`fakes`] behind the `fakes` feature.
