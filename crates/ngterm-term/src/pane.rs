//! [`Pane`]: one terminal — a libghostty-vt terminal behind a mutex, a PTY child, and its threads: the PTY actor's
//! (`ngterm-pty`: reads the PTY into the pane's [`Mailbox`] and writes the input and the terminal's replies to it; one
//! polling thread on Unix, a reader and a writer on Windows), the IO worker (feeds the mailbox's output to the VT,
//! stopping at clipboard reads for their answers), and the waiter (reports the child's exit). A live pane has no PTY
//! and no child: its session's attach stream, read and written by threads of [`crate::session_io`], takes the
//! actor's and the waiter's places, and the same IO worker feeds its output to the VT. A HUD's painted pane has neither
//! either: the painter's thread ([`crate::painted`]) takes their places.
//!
//! Locks (Technical Details > Threads): `vt` → `capture` → leaves (`armed`, `published`, `divert`), and `vt` →
//! `search`, never the reverse. The IO thread holds `vt` for one bounded slice of `vt_write` at a time; input
//! ([`crate::input`]), selection and read-back hold it for one encode or format; the search worker
//! ([`crate::search`]) for one feed, and ticks with `search` alone. Painting ([`Pane::frame`]) `try_lock`s `vt` and
//! then `capture`, keeps `vt` only for the begin phase of the capture, and draws the previous frame when either is
//! busy. Effect callbacks run under `vt` and copy into channels, except the render-hold callback, which takes `capture`
//! (VT → capture, the one order) and captures the held frame there; nothing may take `vt` while holding `capture`.
//!
//! A synchronized-output hold the program never ends is ended after a second by whichever comes first: a paint, or
//! the IO worker, which waits on its mailbox with that deadline while a hold is on and wakes the frontend.
//!
//! While the worker waits on a clipboard answer, the program's output waits in the mailbox until the mailbox's high
//! mark pauses the actor's reads ([`crate::mailbox`]); the actor keeps writing the program's input.
