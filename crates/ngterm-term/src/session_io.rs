//! A live pane's IO: its session on the session server, attached in process through `ngterm-session`'s client
//! library, in place of a PTY and a child. The pane's terminal is fed the session's snapshot and output as it is fed a
//! PTY's (the same mailbox, IO worker and VT slicing); its input, grid and reply facts go to the server.
//!
//! - **What it attaches to** ([`resolve`]): what `ngterm-session attach` would read when the pane ran it as its
//!   command — the attach contract read from the environment the attach would be started in (the app's, under the
//!   launch's variables, `ngterm_session::cli::Contract`), the working directory it would start in, and the session
//!   and creation argv of core's [`LiveAttach`], the data its shell line is made from. A session the attach creates
//!   gets that environment and directory, as the CLI gives it its own.
//! - **Threads**: `pane-live` connects (starting the server when none runs), reads the stream and hands its output to
//!   the pane's mailbox, pausing while the mailbox is past its high mark (the server then resyncs the pane, as any
//!   slow client); the other events that must follow the output fed before them (a snapshot's end, a reply ownership
//!   change, a Kitty barrier, a delegated request) go through the mailbox too, and the IO worker handles them
//!   ([`handle`]). `pane-live-out` sends what the pane queues ([`Live::input`] within the pane's write limit, never
//!   blocking the caller) in order. A connection that ends without the session's exit (a server stopping, or handing
//!   its sessions to a new build) is attached again as the CLI attaches ([`attach_again`]), under the lead the pane
//!   held, its terminal reset first ([`snapshot::RESYNC_RESET`]).
//! - **Replies**: the server answers the program's queries; the pane's terminal answers none but Kitty graphics
//!   commands, whose answers complete the server's barriers ([`crate::outlet::ReplyOutlet`]). The pane is the reply owner
//!   when the server makes it one: it sends its facts (theme colours, cell size, colour scheme, Kitty graphics) with
//!   the attach and on every change, and the frontend answers a delegated clipboard read as any of the pane's own
//!   ([`crate::PaneEvent::ClipboardRead`]). The clipboard reads in the output are the server's to delegate, so the
//!   pane does not stop at them.
//! - **Lead**: a managed pane's role comes as the attach contract's role title, reported as the pane's title
//!   ([`crate::PaneEvent::Title`]) without touching its terminal's own.
//! - **End**: the session's exit ends the pane under its [`crate::ExitPolicy`], as the attach CLI's exit with the
//!   program's status did; an attach that fails (no session to reattach, the server refusing, a broken contract)
//!   writes why and ends it with the CLI's status. Dropping the pane detaches it, leaving the session running.
//!
//! The snapshot is the server's formatter snapshot, the one the CLI and remote attaches take, not libghostty-vt's
//! binary codec: the codec decodes into a new terminal of the server's settings (the pane's has the frontend's theme,
//! scrollback limits, Kitty storage and effects), both ends would have to run one pin with a wire choice for it, and
//! at the pin it carries no Kitty images either.
