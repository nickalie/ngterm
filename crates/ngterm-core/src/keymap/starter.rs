/// The file's head: the three verbs, their rules and examples.
const STARTER_HEAD: &str = r#"# ngterm keymap — a kitty-flavored config for rebinding built-in shortcuts and defining
# custom shell commands. Edit this file and run File ▸ Reload Keymap (or `ngtermctl keymap
# reload`) to apply. Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored. A line that is
# rejected or skipped is reported in Settings ▸ Key Mapping and by `ngtermctl keymap list`.
#
# Three verbs:
#
#   map <chord> [--repeat] <action>
#       Rebind a built-in action. Chords use kitty syntax: mods joined by `+`, e.g.
#       `cmd+shift+l`, `ctrl+\``. Mods: ctrl, cmd, opt, shift. A Shift-typed symbol is
#       shift+<base key> (shift+/ for ?, shift+= for +, shift+5 for %). Several
#       alternatives may be joined by `|` with no spaces around it; the first single-chord
#       alternative becomes the menu shortcut and the rest fire through a key monitor, so
#       their first chord needs a modifier or a function key (f1 through f20). A line offering
#       no single chord leaves the action with no menu shortcut at all. `--repeat` keeps a
#       leader's prefix live until half a second after its key is released, so its last key
#       repeats on its own (tmux `bind -r`): `ctrl+a>ctrl+l` then `ctrl+l` fires twice. Examples:
#
#           map cmd+shift+l     toggle_split
#           map cmd+t|ctrl+a>t  toggle_scratch
#
#   command "<name>" [chord] [--repeat] <shell...>
#       Define a custom command, shown in the action palette marked `custom`. The quoted
#       name may contain spaces. An optional chord (single chord OR a leader like `ctrl+a>g`,
#       or several of either joined by `|`) binds it to a key; every alternative must start with
#       a modifier or a function key (f1 through f20). Others are dropped, and a line left with
#       none becomes palette-only. Omit the chord for a palette-only command. The rest of the
#       line is run via `/bin/sh -c`, detached with no terminal — so it suits fire-and-forget
#       launches (GUI apps, scripts), NOT a bare interactive or full-screen TUI program, which
#       has no TTY and exits at once. Launch a TUI over a session through an overlay terminal,
#       as the Lazygit example does. The line resolves binaries against the app's own `PATH`
#       plus the directory of the bundled ngtermctl, so a bare ngtermctl works; anything else
#       your shell profile adds may not, so give it an absolute path or wrap the line in
#       `$SHELL -lc '...'` — `$SHELL -ilc '...'` when that PATH comes from an interactive rc
#       file, which -lc does not read. The program an overlay or scratch terminal runs gets the
#       app's own unwidened PATH and always needs one of those.
#       Examples:
#
#           command "Open folder"  cmd+shift+e  xdg-open "$AGT_SESSION_PWD"
#           command "Lazygit"      ctrl+a>g     ngtermctl session overlay open 'sh -lc lazygit' --target "$AGT_SESSION_ID" --socket "$AGT_SOCKET"
#           command "Deploy"                    ./deploy.sh
#
#   global-hotkey <chord>
#       Bind ONE system-wide chord that summons the quick terminal while any application has
#       the keyboard — the only binding here that fires when ngterm does not. Exactly one
#       chord: no `|` alternatives, no leader sequence. A modifier is required except for
#       function keys (f1 through f20). A second global-hotkey line replaces the first.
#       ngterm registers it by physical key position, so it works on a non-Latin layout: on
#       X11 as a key grab, on Windows as a system hotkey; on Wayland through the desktop's
#       global shortcuts portal (KDE Plasma, GNOME 48 and later, Hyprland), which gets the
#       chord by key name, so whether it survives a layout switch is up to the desktop, and
#       which may ask you to confirm or change it. A Wayland compositor without that portal
#       gives an app no system-wide key at all: there, bind a custom shortcut in the
#       desktop's own settings that runs `ngtermctl quick toggle` instead. The desktop owns
#       the chord, so it takes no part in the collision rules above, and it WINS, ngterm
#       included, so a chord shared with a menu action fires this and the menu binding never
#       sees it. There is no default: registering a chord takes it from every other
#       application. Spending it on the chord the in-app binding already uses is how to get
#       ONE shortcut that works everywhere.
#       Examples:
#
#           global-hotkey ctrl+opt+space
#           global-hotkey f5  # takes F5 desktop-wide, including from local map/command bindings
#           global-hotkey ctrl+`            # same chord as the in-app quick_terminal binding
