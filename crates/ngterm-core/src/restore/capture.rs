//! A pane's foreground program, read two ways (upstream's `Ghostty/ForegroundProcess.swift`), and the restore capture
//! that fills the sessions' slots at quit, at the last window's close and on demand (`AppDelegate.
//! captureForegroundCommands`).
//!
//! The terminal reports its foreground process GROUP; the process table answers the rest:
//!
//! - [`ForegroundReader::running`], for the `tree`: the group leader's argv, classified as a program or a recognized
//!   shell; when the leader's argv cannot be read (it exited, `cat f | less` keeps the reaped `cat`'s group), the
//!   group's surviving members are tried as upstream's descent does. A `--command` pane's program is run by
//!   libghostty as `/bin/sh -c <command>` on Linux, where macOS's libghostty has bash `exec -l <command>`; a `/bin/sh`
//!   that does not exec its last command (dash, Debian's and Ubuntu's) stays as the group's leader over the program,
//!   so that wrapper is passed over for its child, the process upstream's `exec` leaves.
//! - [`ForegroundReader::command`], for the restore capture: the leader's program only, and never the pane's own
//!   creation command. Upstream gets that from macOS, where a `--command` pane's program runs under setuid `login`,
//!   whose argv is unreadable, so a leader-only read finds nothing there. On Linux the foreground group of a pane with
//!   no job-control shell IS the process libghostty spawned, the terminal's session leader, readable. So the capture
//!   refuses a group led by the session leader: a `--command` program (exec'd by `sh -c` or not), a shell wrapper
//!   (`--command "sh -c 'a; b'"`: no job control, so every child stays in the leader's group), a shell sitting at its
//!   prompt, or one that `exec`ed a program. A job an interactive shell starts gets its own group, led by the job,
//!   whatever started that shell, so a program typed into a shell pane (also inside `--command /bin/sh`) and the
//!   first element of a typed pipeline are captured. A captured argv then preempts the creation command on the next
//!   launch, while a refused one leaves the creation command to the exec path, with `--wait` and close-on-exit.
//!
//! PowerShell (a Rust-only extension, the shell of a live PowerShell pane) has no job control on Linux and macOS:
//! every native program it starts, in the foreground or in the background (`Start-Process -NoNewWindow`, a thread
//! job's, a `Start-Job` worker, a prompt helper such as `git status`), stays in the shell's own group, led by the
//! shell, and nothing in the process table tells its foreground program from the others. So native children sharing
//! an interactive PowerShell leader's group are not inferred: the group reads as that shell, the capture finds
//! nothing, the `tree` shows the shell and a restart replays nothing, so a Unix PowerShell pane restores to its prompt
//! rather than replaying a program that was not in its foreground. A PowerShell running a script or a command
//! (`-File`, `-Command` without `-NoExit`) is a program like any other, and a descendant that leads a group of its
//! own reads as any job does.
//!
//! Windows has no process groups and no terminal foreground: the terminal reports a stand-in process
//! (`ngterm-session`'s `console_foreground`, the oldest program the pane's console runs), and the process table
//! models the rest as above, so the same two reads apply. A process the app started onto its pseudoconsole stands in
//! for the session leader, and a process with its descendants for its group. A `--command` pane runs its line through
//! `cmd.exe /D /S /C`, which has no job control: the stand-in is then that wrapper, so the `tree` looks past it
//! ([`is_command_wrapper`]) and the capture refuses it, as it refuses `/bin/sh -c`.
