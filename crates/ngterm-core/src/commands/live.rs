//! Live sessions in the app (upstream's `agterm/Control/ControlServer+Zmx.swift`, `ControlDispatcher+Zmx.swift`, the
//! zmx wiring of `agtermApp.swift`, `Ghostty/ZmxLaunch.swift`, `ZmxForegroundResolver.swift`, `PaneLead.swift` and the
//! Live sessions reset): the frontend installs a [`SessionHost`] over the staged session server and the wrap inputs,
//! and this module owns everything the core decides with them.
//!
//! - the runtime (here): what the frontend installed, the launch reap's findings, the pane finalizer that ends a
//!   removed pane's daemon, and the requests a command leaves for the frontend (a pane replaced in place, a quit);
//! - [`claims`]: every pane expecting a daemon, open, pending-close, closed and unindexed windows alike;
//! - [`inventory`]: `live.list`, `live.prune`, `live.kill`, `live.screen`;
//! - [`lead`]: the lead book fed by the panes' role reports, the covered panes' reads and typing through the daemon,
//!   `session.lead` and the reattach;
//! - [`launch`]: a pane's launch disposition and the live seed, the leader cache behind a live pane's foreground, and
//!   the launch reap;
//! - [`live_reset`]: `live.reset`, its marker at quit and its consumption at the next launch.
