//! The app side of restore modes (upstream's `GhosttyApp.restoreLaunchDecision`, `restoreDenylist`, the
//! `SpawnRegistry` and `LaunchSeedProvider` wiring in `agtermApp.swift`, and `AppDelegate`'s exit captures): the
//! launch decision and denylist read once, the pane spawns the frontend asks permission for, the grants it collects
//! after each settle, and the foreground captures at quit and at the last window's close.
//!
//! The frontend creates a session pane's terminal only once the core handed it the pane's [`LaunchSeed`]: it asks
//! with [`Core::request_pane_spawn`] when the terminal is ready, and gets the seed at once or later through
//! [`Core::take_spawn_grants`].
//!
//! # Lazy restore
//!
//! A restored session spawns nothing until it is first shown (this build's choice; upstream mounts every restored
//! pane at launch and paces their spawns): its panes stay dormant, their
//! seeds and captured commands on the session, so a quit still saves them for the next launch and a live pane's
//! daemon runs on unattached. [`Core::wake_session`] wakes a session: it is on screen ([`Core::wake_shown_sessions`],
//! the selected session, a zoom, a dashboard cell) or a command needs its terminal. A session made at runtime spawns
//! at once, shown or not. With only the shown sessions spawning, upstream's launch spawn pacer has nothing to pace,
//! and the build has none.
