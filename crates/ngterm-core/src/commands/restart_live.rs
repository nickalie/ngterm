//! The live half of `session.restart` (upstream's `restartSessionPane` in `ControlServer+Restart.swift`): ends a live
//! pane's daemon and builds the pane a new terminal whose daemon runs the caller's line, or the pane's foreground
//! program again, under the same pane identity, so the daemon keeps its name. Either returns to the login shell after
//! it ([`crate::live::support::Creation::ReturningToShell`]), unlike a pane's own creation command, which ends the pane.
//!
//! The steps wait on the daemons, each probe a main-loop hop apart ([`Dispatched::Pending`]): the old shell is listed
//! first (a pane just created reads as backed before its daemon exists), every replay refusal is decided before
//! anything is ended, the kill must be confirmed, the old program gets a second to act on the hangup and is then
//! killed, and only once it is gone does the new terminal start, so it cannot meet a held port or lock. The pane's exit
//! is claimed from the kill on, so the dying client cannot close the pane the restart rebuilds.
