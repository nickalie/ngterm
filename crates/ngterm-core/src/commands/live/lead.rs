//! Explicit live-session leadership in the app (upstream's `ZmxLeadBook`, `Ghostty/PaneLead.swift` and
//! `ControlServer+PaneLead.swift`): a wrapped pane's attach reports its role as a terminal title, a pane that does not
//! lead is covered, and taking the lead is always a fresh attach into a new terminal, since the covered one drew output
//! laid out for another client's grid. A pane whose attach reported a role reads its screen and cursor, and types,
//! through the daemon: the role is a report up to 250 ms behind the daemon, so it never guarantees delivery through the
//! pane's own surface.
