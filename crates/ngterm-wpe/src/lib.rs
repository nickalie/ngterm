//! WPE `WebKit` host for the GPUI frontend's HTML overlays: pages rendered offscreen by WPE `WebKit` (the
//! `WPEPlatform` API) on an engine thread of their own, frames handed to the consumer as dmabufs on its GPU, or as SHM
//! pixels where dmabuf import fails.
//!
//! - [`Host::start`] spawns the engine thread with its own `GMainContext` (thread-default before any `WebKit` object
//!   exists) and a display that renders on the consumer's render node with the formats it imports ([`HostConfig`],
//!   [`FrameMode`]). One engine per process: `WebKit` binds its main run loop to the first thread that uses it, and
//!   that thread never ends (a shutdown closes everything and leaves it idle; the process then ends through
//!   [`exit_process`], since `WebKit`'s exit handlers must not run off its main thread).
//! - Commands go in through [`Host`]'s methods; everything else comes out as [`Event`]s on one channel: frames, load
//!   progress, what a page shows, and the questions `WebKit` asks (navigation and response policy, script messages,
//!   reads of the consumer's URI schemes), each held open until the consumer answers it by token.
//! - Frames follow `WebKit`'s buffer protocol (module `frames`): a frame counts as rendered once the consumer presented
//!   it, and a dmabuf goes back one frame later; acknowledgements run from a source of their own on the engine's
//!   context, never inside `WebKit`'s own hand-over. A page whose dmabufs the consumer cannot import falls back to
//!   SHM frames while it runs ([`Host::fall_back_to_shm`]).
//! - The `WebKit` surface the overlay uses: browser stores ([`SessionSpec`]: in memory, or on disk for saved logins;
//!   downloads refused), [`Settings`], user scripts and script message handlers, navigation and response policy, URI
//!   schemes, and what a page may not do (new windows, dialogs, file choosers, permissions, full screen) refused.
//! - [`worker`]: the engine in a process of its own, which the vendored WPE `WebKit` (its helpers at a compiled-in
//!   path, reachable only inside an overlay of `/usr/lib`, [`launcher`]) always gets, so the consumer itself never runs
//!   in that overlay's user namespace; [`Host::start_worker`] asks for one anywhere. The worker's environment, which
//!   its web processes inherit, carries a request size for their `PulseAudio` streams that keeps Web Audio playing on
//!   a Bluetooth sink (module `worker`). Every program that may start an engine calls [`worker::serve_if_asked`] first
//!   thing in its `main`.
//!
//! - What `WebKitGTK` draws itself and an offscreen page cannot (module `engine::interaction`): the clipboard
//!   (`WPEPlatform`'s is the engine's own: a page's copy is reported, the desktop's text is handed in before a paste),
//!   `<select>` popups and the context menu (reported for the consumer to draw, answered by token or by editing
//!   command), and input methods (an `WPEInputMethodContext` of the engine's that takes the consumer's composition and
//!   commits and reports the caret's area).
//!
//! Not here: accessibility (an offscreen page has no AT-SPI bridge into the consumer's tree).
