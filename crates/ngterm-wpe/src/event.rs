//! What the engine reports ([`Event`]), and the requests among them the consumer answers by token.

//! `WebKit` asks some questions synchronously (may this navigation go on, what does this URI serve, what does this
//! script message get back); the engine holds each one open, reports it with a token and answers it when the consumer
//! does ([`crate::Host::decide_policy`], [`crate::Host::reply_script_message`],
//! [`crate::Host::finish_scheme_request`]). Closing a page answers what it left open: navigations are ignored,
//! script messages get "page closed", scheme requests fail.
