//! The app's side of the worker (module docs of `worker`): the start and its handshake, the writer and reader
//! threads, evaluations by id, the shutdown and the reaping.
//!
//! The worker is not trusted (`message` checks what it sends), and what the app keeps for it stays bounded: the
//! pages it knows are the ones the app made (`Command::CreateView`) and has not closed; a frame of any other page is
//! dropped where it arrives, its planes closed. Each page's dmabufs are kept (one `Arc` per buffer, as the in-process
//! engine hands them out) until they leave its set (`Event::BuffersRemoved`), the page closes (`Command::CloseView`)
//! or the worker ends, at most [`MAX_BUFFERS`] of them; at most [`MAX_UNANSWERED`] of a page's frames wait for the
//! app's answer, and one past them is answered here unseen. Events wait in a queue of [`EVENT_QUEUE`], which holds the
//! reader (and so the worker, through the socket) while the app catches up; a shutdown closes it first.
//!
//! What goes the other way is bounded too ([`Outgoing`]), only to keep a worker that stopped reading from growing the
//! app's memory: the app's own traffic, large or bursty, does not break a worker that reads (only hard bounds no
//! realistic traffic nears would). The app's commands and the reader's answers
//! wait for the writer in one queue whose working set is [`OUTGOING_PACKETS`] packets and [`OUTGOING_BYTES`] bytes.
//! Past either the queue is backlogged, which breaks nothing by itself: a large paste, a session's pages or a burst of
//! input may outrun a writer that has not run yet. A worker reads its socket all the time (its engine takes each
//! command without waiting), so the evidence that it stopped is a backlog through which the writer completed no send
//! for [`STALL_TIMEOUT`]: the next command then breaks the transport, as the worker's death would (its pages fail).
//! Past [`HARD_PACKETS`] or [`HARD_BYTES`] it breaks at once, so a worker that reads too slowly cannot grow the queue
//! for long. The reader's own answers to frames past the unanswered bound have an allowance of their own
//! ([`OUTGOING_UNSEEN`]), past which the transport breaks at once: only a worker that breaks the frame protocol causes
//! them. A command larger than the worker reads at all (`wire::Limits::FROM_APP`) never goes: what keeps its page's
//! state goes instead ([`Client::refuse`]). Nothing that queues ever waits for the worker, neither GPUI's main thread
//! nor the reader with the pages locked, and neither drops a backlog: the writer does, once the queue closed.
