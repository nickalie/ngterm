//! The attach client between the session and the outer terminal: the session's output filtered on its way out
//! (`super::filter`), the client's own sequences written where they split nothing of the program's, and the reply
//! owner's part (`server::replies`): the facts the server answers the program's queries with taken from the outer
//! terminal, and the requests only the owner answers relayed to it.
//!
//! # What the client writes of its own
//!
//! - The role title of a managed attach (`server::lead::role_title`), the newest replacing one not yet written: zmx's
//!   relay (`role.zig` of upstream's `scripts/zmx-patches/0001-explicit-leadership.patch`). A sequence that stays
//!   unfinished for [`INJECT_WAIT`] is ended with CAN, which only a terminal whose client is changing role or relaying
//!   sees.
//! - A probe at the start, when the client runs in a terminal: OSC 10, 11 and 12, OSC 4 for the 256 colours, `CSI 16
//!   t` (the cell's pixels), `CSI ? 996 n` (dark or light), a Kitty graphics query, and DA1 last, whose answer (the
//!   fence) says every answer before it is in. Mode 2031 is turned on in the outer terminal, so a change of its
//!   appearance is reported, and the colours are asked for again then; a RIS on its way to the outer terminal (the
//!   program's own, the reset of a reattach or of a resync) turns it off there, so the filter turns it on again right
//!   after one (`super::filter`).
//! - A DA1 fence after each Kitty graphics command the client owns the answer to: the outer terminal answers the
//!   command first, then DA1, so the Kitty answers read before the fence's are that command's (and its earlier ones'),
//!   which complete its barrier. The fence goes after the command's ST (the barrier comes when the output stands at
//!   its ESC, so it is the first ground place).
//! - For a delegated clipboard read, an OSC 52 read of the outer terminal's clipboard, alone: no fence, since a terminal
//!   that asks its user first (Ghostty's `clipboard-read = ask`, kitty's `read-clipboard-ask`) answers a DA1 at once
//!   and the read only once the user agreed. The read waits for its answer up to [`DELEGATION_WAIT`] from its request,
//!   the server's own bound, then is denied. An OSC 52 answer carries no request of its own, so one read at most is
//!   asked of the outer terminal at a time, and the next OSC 52 answer is that read's: a read whose time ran out (or
//!   whose connection ended) stays unresolved, its answer discarded when it comes, and every read meanwhile is denied
//!   without asking. A terminal that never answers a read thus holds the session's first read for the whole wait
//!   (the server holds the program's output behind it, `server::replies`), and denies the later ones at once.
//!   Until the asked read's answer comes ([`Relay::clipboard_asked`]), the input keeps an OSC 52 answer's framing
//!   once its header is recognized, however long it takes and whether or not its read is still live, so none of it
//!   is typed (`super::input`, with what that leaves: a header cut before its `52`, garbage inside an answer).
//!
//! - An endpoint advertising the attach bridge accepts `attach-bridge` under `NGTERM_ATTACH_BRIDGE=<version>:<nonce>`.
//!   The viewer supplies the nonce and accepts only matching envelopes. MIME contents, authoritative consent,
//!   completion and lazy pastes travel through it. Reserved prefixes are suppressed both before and after output
//!   filtering, before trusted relay injections are mixed in. Older endpoints use ordinary `attach`.
//! - External terminals are probed with a list-only OSC 5522 read. Supported terminals get correlated
//!   multipart reads/writes and complete writes only on their native status. An opaque server alias lets
//!   the outer terminal remember consent; actual program passwords never enter permission events.
//!   A native paste keeps its outer token here and registers only an opaque bridge and its types with the
//!   server. Listings read no contents; a follow-up fetch requests at most four representations lazily.
//! - Without OSC 5522 support, reads retain the OSC 52 text adapter. Delegated OSC 52/1337 writes and
//!   explicit clears still use OSC 52 and complete when emitted.
//!
//! An outer terminal that answers no DA1 within [`PROBE_GIVE_UP`] gets no fences: barriers are completed empty at
//! once and clipboard reads denied, and the metadata says it shows no Kitty graphics.
//!
//! # The metadata
//!
//! The colours from the answers, the 256 colours only when all came; the cell's pixels from the window size the
//! terminal reports with the grid (`TIOCGWINSZ`, from the start), else from `CSI 16 t`; the appearance;
//! Kitty graphics when the outer terminal answered the query and answers fences. It is sent when the probe's fence
//! comes, again when a refresh's does, and whenever the cell size changes.
