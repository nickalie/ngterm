//! The session's output on its way to the outer terminal: every query the session server answers itself taken out, so
//! the outer terminal answers none of the program's queries (the server's one answer is the only one), and the places
//! where the stream stands at ground found, where the attach client may write its own sequences (a role title, a
//! fence, a query of its own) without splitting one of the program's.
//!
//! The filter follows the states of Ghostty's VT parser (`src/terminal/parse_table.zig` at `LIBGHOSTTY_VT_REV`, its
//! "anywhere" transitions included), as [`ngterm_ghostty_vt::Scanner`] mirrors them (`ngterm-ghostty-vt`'s
//! `scan.rs`); a sequence that may be a query is held until it is complete, whatever the reads it comes in, then
//! dropped, passed on, or passed on rewritten. A sequence that cannot be a query is passed on as it comes. Held:
//!
//! - every CSI, up to [`CSI_LIMIT`] bytes (a longer one is passed on as it comes). Dropped: DA1, DA2 and DA3
//!   (`CSI [>=] Ps c`), DSR and CPR (`CSI [?] Ps n`, `CSI ? 996 n` included), DECRQM (`CSI [?] Ps $ p`), XTVERSION
//!   (`CSI > Ps q`), the Kitty keyboard flags query (`CSI ? u`) and the XTWINOPS reports Ghostty answers
//!   (`CSI 14/16/18/21 t`). Rewritten: DECSET and DECRST (`CSI ? Pm h|l`) lose modes 2031 and 2048, whose reports the
//!   server sends from its own terminal (and the attach client keeps its own 2031 subscription on the outer terminal:
//!   [`OutputFilter::after_reset`] puts it back after every RIS that passes, which turns it off),
//!   and mode 9001, win32-input-mode, which a Windows session's pseudoconsole asks of its terminal as it starts: an
//!   outer terminal that took it would encode its input, its answers to the client and the detach key included, as
//!   win32 key records the client does not read (`super::input` reads VT), and the session's pseudoconsole reads the
//!   plain VT the client forwards as well. A C0 control inside a CSI executes in passing, as in Ghostty's parser: the
//!   CSI is classified without it, and a dropped or rewritten one keeps its controls, ahead of what is written;
//! - every OSC, up to [`STRING_LIMIT`] bytes. Dropped: the colour queries (OSC 10 to 19 with a `?`, Kitty's OSC 21
//!   with a `key=?`), clipboard reads (OSC 52 `?`, Kitty's OSC 5522 `type=read`); OSC 4 loses its `index;?` pairs.
//!   Rewritten: a prompt mark `OSC 133;A` gets `redraw=0` (zmx's `rewritePromptRedraw`, `src/util.zig` at `8bab1f0`,
//!   MIT, NOTICE): the outer terminal must not clear the prompt's rows on a resize expecting the shell to redraw them,
//!   since the shell redraws through the session, laid out for the session's grid;
//! - a DCS's header: DECRQSS (`DCS $ q`) and XTGETTCAP (`DCS + q`) are dropped with their strings;
//! - ESC Z (DECID, Ghostty's DA1) is dropped, and so is ENQ (Ghostty's answerback).
//!
//! A string the filter dropped and ended with ESC takes the `\` of its ST with it. The Kitty graphics commands (APC G)
//! pass: the outer terminal shows the images, and the reply owner's terminal answers them (`super::owner`).
//!
//! With delegated clipboards enabled, all OSC 52, OSC 5522 and OSC 1337 Copy= commands, writes included,
//! are suppressed as soon as their prefix is known. Snapshots forward them for recovery replay.
//! [`OutputFilter::clipboard_only`] keeps only this suppression for live viewers, without outer-terminal rewrites.
