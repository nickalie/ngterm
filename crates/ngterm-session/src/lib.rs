//! ngterm's live-session server, on herdr's architecture: one background server per ngterm instance owns every live
//! pane's PTY and terminal state, and the app, `ngtermctl` and other viewers are its clients.
//!
//! This crate holds, so far, the parts every other one stands on:
//!
//! - [`protocol`]: the wire, frames with a stable header and a stable JSON control layer every version reads, and the
//!   postcard messages of the api and attach roles;
//! - [`endpoint`]: where a namespace's server listens, a Unix domain socket or a Windows named pipe, owner-only;
//! - [`server`]: the server's lifecycle: started on demand by a client that finds none, detached from it per OS, one
//!   per namespace, stopped by itself once it holds no session and no client. The `ngterm-session` binary runs it as
//!   `ngterm-session server <namespace directory>`. Its pane runtime ([`server::pane`]) runs a session's program on
//!   a PTY, keeps the session's terminal state and fans its output out to the attached clients
//!   ([`server::clients`]), each starting from a snapshot of the session ([`server::snapshot`]) and resynced in band
//!   when it falls behind; attach connections reach them, and api connections list, kill, read, type into and print
//!   into them and read a shell's foreground job ([`server::api`]), what `SessionHost` and `ngtermctl clipboard set`
//!   need; and it hands every session over to a server of another build without ending them (its update handoff,
//!   [`server::handoff`]);
//! - [`build_id`]: the build a server reports and a client expects, the hash of the staged binary;
//! - [`launch`]: what a live launch reads of this host (the session host executable, its build id, the login shell,
//!   the Ghostty resources, the namespace's state directory) and the wrap configuration of a pane over it;
//! - [`procfs`]: the Linux process table's files (`stat`, `cmdline`), which the job table and the process table read;
//! - [`job`]: a terminal's foreground job on every OS and the sweeper that hangs up what a killed session's shell
//!   leaves running;
//! - [`process_table`]: the process table a pane's foreground is read through, on every OS;
//! - [`client`]: the client library: the api and a session's attach stream, its contract checked on the client's side;
//! - [`host`]: the `SessionHost` over the client ([`host::ServerHost`]), with upstream `ZmxClient`'s error kinds and
//!   outcomes;
//! - [`cli`]: the binary's client commands: `attach`, the attach contract's terminal client and the session's reply
//!   owner over [`attach_tty`] (the outer terminal, the output's filter, the input's answers), and the api's `list`,
//!   `kill`, `screen`, `type`, `print` and `version`.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! The code is taken from herdr (<https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr>, Apache-2.0) at the commit `build/pins.env` pins
//! as `HERDR_REV`, trimmed to what ngterm uses and reworked. herdr's files carry no license header, so every derived
//! file names in its header the herdr file it comes from, that it is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, and that
//! it was modified; herdr's license is in the repository's `NOTICE`. Hence the crate's `MIT AND Apache-2.0`.
