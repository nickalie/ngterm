//! The session server's endpoint in an instance's namespace: a Unix domain socket in the namespace directory, a named
//! pipe on Windows.
//!
//! herdr: `src/ipc.rs` and `src/server/socket_paths.rs` at `HERDR_REV` (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache
//! License 2.0, modified. Kept: `interprocess` local sockets; binding after `prepare_socket_path`'s stale-socket check
//! (a socket nobody listens on is removed, a live one refused as busy), owner-only socket permissions, the socket
//! file's identity so a server removes only the file it bound, the timed connect (on Windows through the named-pipe
//! API, since the local-socket wrapper ignores its wait mode), the peer-closed probe and the closed-connection error
//! kinds; on Windows the owner-only pipe DACL of `bind_private_local_listener` with the integrity label of
//! `platform/windows.rs` `local_server_security_descriptor`. Changed: the paths come from ngterm's namespace, not
//! herdr's session directories and overrides; an over-long Unix socket path is refused before anything is touched;
//! Windows derives the pipe's name from the namespace directory instead of writing a marker file, creates it with
//! `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE` (ngterm's addition, which `interprocess` sets on a listener's first instance); a
//! Unix server holds the namespace's `flock` from before the stale-socket check for as long as it listens (ngterm's
//! addition, so two racing servers cannot both bind) and keeps the lock file's times current while it listens
//! ([`Listener::keep_current`], ngterm's addition after upstream agterm's #733, so a temp-dir cleaner does not age the
//! file out from under the namespace's guard); and a client checks that the server runs as its own user. The pipe's
//! descriptor, that check and the pipe naming scheme live in ngterm-core (`pipe_security`, `paths::pipe_name`),
//! shared with the control socket's pipe (ngterm-server).
//!
//! # Namespace
//!
//! A namespace is a directory: on Unix `/tmp/ngterm-live-<hash>`, on Windows
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ngterm\live\<hash>` (Task 21 derives both from the state dir). The endpoint is
//!
//! - Unix: the socket `<directory>/`[`SOCKET_FILE_NAME`], in a directory created owner-only, beside the lock file
//!   [`LOCK_FILE_NAME`] its server holds;
//! - Windows: the pipe `\\.\pipe\ngterm-live-<FNV-1a 64 of the case-folded directory path>` ([`pipe_name`]), so a
//!   client that holds only the directory (`NGTERM_LIVE_DIR`) finds it. A private directory gives a private pipe.
