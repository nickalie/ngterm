//! The session server's client library: the api a `SessionHost` and `ngtermctl` call, and a session's attach stream,
//! synchronous, for a caller's own threads (`ngterm-term`'s IO thread, the `ngterm-session` CLI).
//!
//! herdr: `src/client/handshake.rs` (connect, hello, the welcome checked before anything else) and `src/client/mod.rs`
//! (a connection's reader and writer halves) at `HERDR_REV` (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License 2.0,
//! modified: ngterm's api calls by id and its raw attach stream ([`crate::protocol`]) in place of herdr's rendered
//! frames, threads in place of tokio, and the stream's contract checked on the client's side (epochs, contiguous
//! offsets, the tokens a delegated request and a Kitty barrier are answered with).
//!
//! # Connecting
//!
//! A [`Client`] names a namespace (its directory, [`Endpoint`]). The api never starts a server: one that does not run
//! holds no session, so [`Client::api`] and [`Client::call`] answer `None` for it. An attach starts one when the client
//! was given [`StartOptions`] ([`Client::starting`]), as the attach that creates a pane's session must
//! ([`spawn::connect_or_start`]); without them it reports [`ClientError::NoServer`].
//!
//! Every api call runs within the client's timeout ([`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`]), connecting included, the whole call
//! together however its reply arrives, a kill within [`KILL_WAIT`] more, as the server answers it once the programs
//! ended; an attach's first answer within [`ATTACH_TIMEOUT`]. A call that outran its timeout drops its connection.
//!
//! # The attach stream
//!
//! [`Client::attach`] sends the attach request and reads the server's first answer: a refusal is
//! [`ClientError::Refused`], anything else the stream's start. The stream then splits in two halves for two threads:
//!
//! - [`AttachReader::recv`] reads the server's messages as [`AttachEvent`]s in order and checks the stream's contract:
//!   each snapshot opens a later epoch (a resync's leads with its own reset, so a client feeds every snapshot and output
//!   byte to its terminal as it comes); output and size changes come only between snapshots, contiguous from the last
//!   snapshot's offset; a delegated request or a Kitty barrier of a superseded epoch is dropped; nothing follows the
//!   exit. A broken contract is [`ClientError::Protocol`]. The stream ends (`Ok(None)`) when the connection closes
//!   in order after the exit or a shutdown (a frame cut or malformed after them is still an error), or once this
//!   client detached or closed it; a connection that ends otherwise is [`ClientError::Disconnected`].
//! - [`AttachWriter`] (cloneable, its writes serialized) sends input, the client's grid, its reply metadata, and the
//!   answers: [`AttachWriter::answer`] takes a delegated request's [`Delegated`] token, [`AttachWriter::complete`] a
//!   [`Barrier`], each once. A Kitty barrier is completed once the client's terminal has *processed* every output byte
//!   [`AttachReader::recv`] returned before the barrier (a caller that feeds each event before it reads the next one
//!   has), with what its terminal answered to the Kitty graphics commands since the previous barrier — and completed
//!   even when that is nothing, since the server holds its own later replies behind it until then. An answer whose
//!   epoch is no longer the stream's current one is not sent: the server would drop it. Its writes take no timeout:
//!   against a server that stopped reading (stopped or deadlocked; a live one queues input and never blocks on it) a
//!   write waits, and holds the writes after it back. [`AttachWriter::detach`] waits for a write in progress for at
//!   most [`DETACH_WAIT`] and closes the connection then; [`AttachWriter::close`] is the call that always returns.
