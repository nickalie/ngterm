//! The session's answers to its program's queries: one answer per query, whichever clients are attached.
//!
//! zmx answered nothing itself: every attached client's own terminal did, so two clients meant two answers and none
//! meant none. Here the server's terminal ([`super::pane`]) answers, through libghostty-vt's effects, so the session
//! has one identity:
//!
//! - **State and capability queries** (DA1/2/3, DSR and CPR, DECRQM, DECRQSS, XTVERSION, XTGETTCAP with the
//!   session's `TERM` as its terminfo name, Kitty keyboard flags, the glyph protocol's glossary, `CSI 21 t`) come
//!   from the terminal's state with Ghostty's identity, as `ngterm-term` answers a plain pane's ([`ServerEffects`]).
//! - **Frontend-dependent queries** (OSC 4/10/11/12 and Kitty's OSC 21 colours, XTWINOPS `14 t`/`16 t` pixel sizes,
//!   mode 2048 reports, `CSI ? 996 n` and mode 2031 reports) come from the reply owner's
//!   [`ReplyMetadata`], applied to the terminal as its defaults (a program's own OSC overrides stay theirs), and from
//!   stable defaults ([`Facts`]) while there is no owner or it left a value out. Kitty images placed on the server's
//!   terminal take the owner's cell size too, so the cursor moves past them as on the owner's screen.
//! - **Clipboard reads** (OSC 52 `?`, Kitty's OSC 5522 reads) need the owner's clipboard, and maybe its user's
//!   consent, which the synchronous read callback cannot wait for. The output is scanned as `ngterm-term` scans a
//!   plain pane's ([`vt::Scanner`]): it is fed to the terminal and fanned out to the clients up to the byte that would
//!   dispatch the read, which is sent to the owner alone as a [`DelegatedRequest`] in its current epoch; the
//!   dispatch byte and the output after it wait in the pane ([`Replies`]), while the PTY keeps being read (up to
//!   [`PARK_HIGH`] bytes held, then the actor's reads pause until they drop under [`PARK_LOW`]). The owner's answer,
//!   or a denial when the owner changes, the owner falls behind or leaves, the program ends or no answer comes within
//!   [`DELEGATION_WAIT`], is armed for the dispatch byte, which is fed alone, so Ghostty still parses, validates and
//!   answers the read; then the held output goes on, scanned again. A pane's helper thread ends a request whose time
//!   is up.
//! - **Kitty graphics** (APC G): the server's terminal keeps the protocol on, its storage bounded
//!   ([`KITTY_STORAGE_LIMIT`]), so it places direct images as the clients do (the cursor moves past them, which the
//!   protocol turned off would not), with its image media off, so a temporary file or shared memory is read once, by a
//!   client that shows it. An image sent that way (`t=f`, `t=t`, `t=s`) fails to load on the server's terminal, which
//!   then places nothing: its cursor stays where the owner's moved away from (with the default `C=0`), so the server
//!   answers CPR and DSR from there and later snapshots put the cursor there, until the program moves it again. Its
//!   own APC G answers are dropped, and the owner's terminal answers instead: the terminal stops at the byte that runs
//!   each terminated command ([`vt::Terminal::vt_write_until`]), and the output up to it is followed by a barrier sent to the owner
//!   alone ([`ClientEvent::KittyBarrier`](super::clients::ClientEvent), when its [`ReplyMetadata::kitty_graphics`]
//!   says it shows them), which it completes with what its terminal answered
//!   ([`AttachClientMessage::KittyComplete`](crate::protocol::AttachClientMessage)), even nothing. The output goes on
//!   meanwhile; the server's replies to what follows wait behind the barrier, so the program reads the owner's answers
//!   before the answers to its later queries (Kitty's detection sends a query, then DA1, and takes DA1 coming first as
//!   no support). A barrier ends empty past [`KITTY_WAIT`], when the owner changes, falls behind, leaves or withdraws
//!   `kitty_graphics`, or past [`HELD_LIMIT`] or [`BARRIER_LIMIT`]. Equal-pin binary handoffs retain images and placements
//!   in the server. Attach/resync use formatter snapshots, which carry no images or glyph registrations, so an image
//!   is not shown again to a client that attaches later.
//!
//! Every reply, whichever thread makes it (a read of the PTY, a client's answer or completion, a resize, a deadline),
//! is queued in the pane's [`Outlet`] under the pane's lock, in that lock's order; one thread, the pane's helper, takes
//! them and writes them to the program, so it reads them in the order of its queries.
//!
//! # The reply owner
//!
//! The leader, else the first managed client attached ([`Lead::reply_owner`](super::lead::Lead::reply_owner)). Every
//! client is told whether it owns the replies before its first snapshot, then on every change, in order with the
//! output ([`ClientEvent::ReplyOwner`](super::clients::ClientEvent)), each change counted by a generation; only the
//! owner is sent Kitty barriers, and a change ends those waiting empty, so no Kitty command is answered twice, though
//! one the leaving owner was still to answer goes unanswered. Only the owner's [`ReplyMetadata`] counts, and a
//! client's is forgotten when it detaches.
//!
//! # What herdr's pane answered itself
//!
//! Checked against the C API at `LIBGHOSTTY_VT_REV` (herdr's `src/pane/` at `HERDR_REV`, Apache-2.0): nothing of it
//! is ported. `osc.rs` tracks OSC 10/11/12 queries and sets so herdr can answer default-colour queries from its host
//! terminal's theme and restore that theme around its own drawing; libghostty-vt answers them from the terminal's
//! default colours (`stream_terminal.zig` `colorOperation`, `Terminal.colorForXterm`), which carry the owner's theme
//! here, and nothing draws in a host terminal. Its title, progress and debug trackers serve herdr's agent detection,
//! and the working directory is the terminal's own (`Terminal::pwd`). `xtgettcap.rs` answers XTGETTCAP sent with an
//! 8-bit C1 DCS, which Ghostty, the reference, leaves unanswered (its parser reads C1 bytes in the ground state as
//! UTF-8). `kitty_keyboard.rs` records the keyboard modes only to replay them across herdr's handoff; the formatter
//! snapshot's extras carry them here.
//!
//! # Windows
//!
//! The pseudoconsole (conhost) runs a terminal of its own between the program and the server: it answers some
//! queries itself, passes others on to its output pipe (re-encoded at times), and keeps others; and the answers the
//! server writes back pass through conhost's input parser, which lets DCS and CSI answers through and drops OSC and
//! APC ones. Recorded by `tests/replies.rs` `windows_conhost_record` (it prints the table) on Windows Server 2025,
//! 10.0.26100.33438 (`windows-2025`, the CI runner), the version measured; another version is recorded by running that
//! test there:
//!
//! | query | reaches the server | the program's answer |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | DA1, DA2, DECRQM | no | conhost's own: `CSI ? 61;6;7;21;22;23;24;28;32;42 c`, `CSI > 0;10;1 c`, not recognized |
//! | CPR | yes | one answer, the cursor's row and column |
//! | DA3, DSR, DECRQSS, XTVERSION, Kitty keyboard flags | yes | the server's |
//! | `CSI ? 996 n`, XTWINOPS `14 t` and `18 t` | yes | the server's |
//! | XTGETTCAP | no | none |
//! | OSC 10, 11, 12 | no | none |
//! | OSC 4 | yes | none (conhost drops the OSC answer) |
//! | OSC 52 read | no | none: no clipboard read is delegated |
//! | Kitty graphics (APC G) | no | none: no image reaches a client |
//!
//! So on that version a program in a live pane still gets one answer per query, never two, but conhost's identity
//! for DA1 and DA2, and no theme colours, clipboard reads or Kitty graphics: the pseudoconsole stands in their way,
//! as it stands in front of a plain pane's program (`ngterm-term` runs it on a pseudoconsole too).
