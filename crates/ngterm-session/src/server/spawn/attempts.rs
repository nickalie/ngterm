//! The handoffs this process asked for, so that a server of another build is asked once ([`super::connect_or_start`]):
//! every attempt disconnects the server's clients, even one that then fails, so a failing handoff asked again by each
//! client reattaching would keep disconnecting the others. Across processes the server itself holds the line: it
//! answers a request for a handoff it failed at once, without running it again ([`crate::server::handoff`]), so this
//! memo saves the round trip and keeps what the server never saw (no handoff capability, a lost answer).
//!
//! The memo is process-wide and keyed by the endpoint, the server's pid and build, and the build expected; it never
//! expires (time passing does not make a refused handoff work): a new server (another pid or build), another expected
//! build or another client process asks again, and a failed attempt leaves the caller's reset offer standing. An
//! attempt is reserved before its request, so a caller racing on it waits for it to settle and then looks again
//! instead of asking a second time; one whose outcome never settled (a reconnect that failed after the request, a
//! panic) counts as failed, with its outcome unknown. Settled with Codex (the run's
//! `discussions/fixer-task-21-handoff-retry`). The callers waiting are counted, for a test that races an attempt
//! ([`super::handoff_waiters`]).
