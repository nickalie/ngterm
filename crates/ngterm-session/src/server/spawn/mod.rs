//! Starting a namespace's server on demand: a client that finds no server starts one detached from itself and waits
//! for its endpoint; of clients that race to start one, every one ends up connected to the same server.
//!
//! herdr: `src/server/autodetect.rs` (`is_server_listening_at`, `spawn_server_daemon`, `build_server_daemon_command`,
//! `wait_for_server_socket`, `auto_detect_launch`) and `src/platform/mod.rs` (`detach_server_daemon_command`,
//! `current_process_is_detached_server_daemon`) at `HERDR_REV` (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License
//! 2.0, modified. Kept: probe the endpoint, spawn `<exe> server` with stdio on the null device and detached per OS,
//! then poll the endpoint until it answers within a deadline; a stale endpoint counts as no server; the second of two
//! racing servers loses the bind and exits. Changed: the probe is a full handshake on the connection the caller then
//! keeps, so a server that stops between the probe and the caller's first request cannot be hit (herdr probes, then
//! reconnects); the server's argv names its namespace directory (`<exe> server <directory>`), so a namespace's server
//! is told from any other by its command line; a server this call started that exits before it is ready is started
//! again only when it lost the namespace to another server ([`super::EXIT_TAKEN`]) or stopped by itself, and reported
//! otherwise; once ready, the server this call started must report itself detached ([`super::CAPABILITY_DETACHED`]) or
//! it is stopped and the start fails, since it would end with its launcher; the child's environment drops the variables
//! of the live session the launcher may run in (`NGTERM_*`; an outer upstream agterm's `AGTERM_*` and its zmx's
//! `ZMX_*`; the isolation rule of AGENTS.md > Never touch the user's running ngterm); and the spawn itself is per OS
//! (the `linux`, `macos` and `windows` modules).
//!
//! # Builds
//!
//! A client expects the build staged beside the executable it would start ([`StartOptions::build`],
//! [`crate::build_id`]). A server of another build found, the client asks it once, on a control connection, to hand
//! its sessions over to that executable ([`crate::server::handoff`]), then connects again; [`Connected::handoff`]
//! says how that went, and a failed attempt is what the caller's reset offer stands on (`ngterm-core`'s
//! `build_record`). A server whose protocol refuses the client's role is asked the same; when that fails the call
//! fails ([`StartError::HandoffFailed`]). Once means once per process for that server and that expected build: a
//! failed attempt is remembered, and later calls report it without asking again, since every attempt disconnects
//! the server's clients (`attempts.rs`). Another client process asking again is answered at once by the server, which
//! does not run a handoff it failed again and disconnects nobody for it ([`crate::server::handoff`]).
//!
//! # Private images on Windows
//!
//! A running executable cannot be replaced on Windows, so a server never runs from the staged binary there: each start
//! (and each handoff's replacement) runs a private copy in the namespace directory (`run\<binary's size, mtime and id>\
//! bin\ngterm-session.exe`, with the staged id beside it when it is the binary's), reused while the staged binary is
//! unchanged, and swept once no server runs it. Staging a new build then never meets a file in use.
