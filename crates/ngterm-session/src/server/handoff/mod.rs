//! The update handoff: a server hands every live session over to a server of another build, and the sessions' programs
//! keep running, with their terminals, through the change.
//!
//! herdr: `src/server/handoff.rs` (the token-authenticated private socket, the JSON manifest, `SCM_RIGHTS` batches of
//! 64, the validated, restored, ready, committed and owned steps with their timeouts) and
//! `src/server/headless/{lifecycle,bootstrap}.rs` (`perform_live_handoff`, `run_handoff_import_server`: the clients
//! disconnected, the panes paused, the replacement spawned, the rollback before the commit) at `HERDR_REV`
//! (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License 2.0, modified as below. The design was settled with Codex
//! (the run's `discussions/task-21-handoff-design`).
//!
//! # The request
//!
//! A client finding a server of another build ([`crate::server::spawn::connect_or_start`]) asks it, on a control
//! connection, to hand over to the replacement executable ([`crate::protocol::HandoffRequest`]); the answer comes once
//! the handoff committed (`ok`) or failed before its commit. A server advertises
//! [`crate::protocol::CAPABILITY_HANDOFF_REQUEST`] when this host can hand over ([`Support`]: on Windows only behind
//! the `ConPTY` layout gate, `windows.rs`). One handoff runs at a time, and a failed one is not run again: a request
//! for the build and protocol of a handoff this server failed is answered at once with that failure's reason, before
//! anything is fenced ([`Failures`]), so a client process that did not see the first attempt (each pane's attach runs
//! in a process of its own) disconnects nobody by asking. Settled with Codex (the run's
//! `discussions/task-25-handoff-retry-across-processes`).
//!
//! # The steps
//!
//! The old server (the exporter):
//!
//! 1. fences the api and attach connections (the server's operation lock, taken exclusively, and a new connection
//!    generation, so no operation decoded before it runs after it), disconnects them, and drops new ones until the
//!    handoff ends (their clients retry, and find whichever server serves then);
//! 2. binds a private channel (an owner-only endpoint under the namespace directory, `handoff-<pid>`) and starts the
//!    replacement detached, as `ngterm-session server <namespace> --handoff-import <channel> <token>`;
//! 3. accepts the replacement on the channel, checks its pid where the OS tells it and its token, and reads its
//!    identity: build, protocol and libghostty-vt pin ([`Identity`]);
//! 4. cuts every pane ([`Pane::freeze`], [`Pane::quiesce`], [`Pane::cut`]; a pane whose program is ending is left
//!    out): the terminal goes as libghostty-vt's binary snapshot when both pins are equal, else as the formatter's VT
//!    restoration ([`VtEncoding`]; a pane the formatter cannot carry fails the handoff, and the client offers the
//!    reset);
//! 5. sends the manifest ([`Manifest`], one JSON line) and each pane's terminal and replies as raw bytes after it;
//!    the replacement answers `validated` once it checked the manifest against itself;
//! 6. passes the endpoint and the PTYs (`unix.rs`: the listening socket, the locked lock file and the masters by
//!    `SCM_RIGHTS`; `windows.rs`: the pseudoconsoles' handles, the programs' processes and jobs duplicated into the
//!    replacement's process, their values in a JSON line, the pipe taken over beside); the replacement answers
//!    `restored` once every pane is rebuilt, inert ([`Pane::import`]), and `ready` once it holds the endpoint and its
//!    accept thread runs, waiting for the commit to accept (so nothing it could fail at is left after the commit);
//! 7. commits by writing `committed`: from the moment that line is written whole, the sessions are the
//!    replacement's, whatever follows (a missing `owned` only logs). Its PTY actors let go of the PTYs
//!    ([`Pane::hand_over`]), it gives up the socket file, answers the request and stops.
//!
//! The replacement (the importer, [`receive`] and `run_import`) does the other half and, on `committed`, makes every
//! pane its own ([`Pane::activate`]), claims the endpoint, opens its accept thread, and answers `owned`.
//!
//! The exporter's steps up to its commit all fit in [`EXPORT_DEADLINE`] from the request (each step's own timeout cut
//! to the time left), so its answer comes within [`ANSWER_WITHIN`], which the client's wait exceeds
//! ([`crate::server::spawn::HANDOFF_TIMEOUT`]).
//!
//! # Rollback
//!
//! Until `committed` is written whole, any failure (a step's [`STEP_TIMEOUT`], a refusal, the replacement's death)
//! rolls back: the replacement is ended and waited for, every pane resumes ([`Pane::resume`]), the connections are
//! taken again, and the request is answered failed, the client then offering the reset. The endpoint was never
//! released, so nothing binds again; the replacement's copies of the PTYs ended with it. A failed write of
//! `committed` means the replacement could not have read the line whole, and it only acts on the whole line.
//!
//! Lost in a handoff, by design: the attached clients' streams (they reattach, from a snapshot) and their reply
//! ownership; a clipboard read waiting for an answer (denied); the Kitty answers a barrier waited for (it ends
//! empty). And at this libghostty-vt pin, from the terminal: Kitty images, their placements and glyph registrations
//! (neither encoding carries them), and across a pin change the saved cursor (the formatter has no extra for it); see
//! `pane/handoff.rs`.
