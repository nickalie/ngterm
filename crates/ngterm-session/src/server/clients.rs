//! The clients attached to one pane, and the queue of what each is sent: its snapshots, the pane's output, tagged
//! with its offset in the session's output stream, its size changes and its end.
//!
//! herdr: `src/server/client_transport.rs` (`ClientWriterQueue`, the per-client writer queue the PTY side pushes into
//! without waiting for the client's socket) and `src/server/clients.rs` (the registry of a session's clients) at
//! `HERDR_REV` (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License 2.0, modified. Kept: a queue per client, filled by
//! the pane and drained by the client's own writer, so a slow client never holds up the PTY reader or the other
//! clients. Changed: the queue carries ngterm's raw output lane, not herdr's rendered frames, so it is lossless where
//! herdr's render lane keeps only the latest frame: it is bounded in bytes, and output that does not fit is never
//! dropped silently. The queue drops the output, size changes and unsent snapshot it holds, none of which was sent
//! yet, and ends with [`ClientEvent::Overflowed`] at the offset where the client's copy of the stream stops; the pane
//! then resyncs that client in band (a new [`ClientEvent::Snapshot`] in place of what it was not sent) or, past its
//! [`ResyncBudget`], disconnects it.
//!
//! # Epochs
//!
//! Every snapshot queued for a client opens an epoch, numbered from 1: its first snapshot, at its attach, then one per
//! resync. A snapshot an overflow drops unsent still used its number, so the first epoch a client is sent is 1 unless
//! its queue overflowed before its first snapshot went out. The output after a snapshot continues it. An answer the
//! client gives in an epoch that is no longer its current one (a delegated reply sent before its resync) is dropped
//! ([`Clients::epoch`]).
//!
//! # Order
//!
//! The pane queues under its own lock, the one that also feeds its terminal, so every client sees the same events in
//! the same order, each output contiguous with the one before it (`offset` plus the length of `data` is the next
//! offset), until its queue overflows or the session ends; a snapshot's offset is where the output after it starts. A
//! managed client's [`ClientEvent::Role`] reports ([`super::lead`]) sit in that order too, its first before anything
//! else it is sent, and outlast an overflow; so do every client's [`ClientEvent::ReplyOwner`] reports
//! ([`super::replies`]), its first right after its first role report. A [`ClientEvent::Delegated`] request and a
//! [`ClientEvent::KittyBarrier`] go to one client in its current epoch, after the output they concern, and an overflow
//! drops them with that output.
//! [`ClientEvent::Exit`] is always queued, after all output, and is the last event of a session.
