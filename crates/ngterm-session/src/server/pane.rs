//! A live session's pane on the server: its program on a PTY ([`ngterm_pty`]), the terminal state that program's
//! output builds ([`ngterm_ghostty_vt::Terminal`]), the clients its output fans out to ([`super::clients`]), and its
//! end; [`Panes`] holds them by session name.
//!
//! herdr: `src/pane.rs` (`PaneRuntime::spawn_command_builder`: the terminal, the PTY spawn, the child watcher and the
//! PTY actor feeding the terminal; `apply_pane_terminal_env`; `shutdown_pane_processes` and its graces),
//! `src/terminal/runtime.rs` (`TerminalRuntime`, the runtime facade) and `src/terminal/runtime_registry.rs`
//! (`TerminalRuntimeRegistry`, the runtimes by id) at `HERDR_REV` (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache
//! License 2.0, modified:
//! - the runtime facade and the pane runtime are one type, [`Pane`], over `ngterm-pty`'s actor and std threads in
//!   place of tokio tasks; agent detection, render signalling, compression and herdr's own terminal identity
//!   (`TERM_PROGRAM`, the host handles it removes) are not ported;
//! - the child's environment is the session's creation input, as zmx gave it ([`child_environment`]), not herdr's
//!   launch environment on top of the server's;
//! - the output is fanned out raw to the attached clients, every read tagged with its offset in the session's
//!   output stream, under the lock that feeds the terminal (the pane's one serialization point);
//! - the shutdown signals the child's process group through `ngterm-pty`'s [`Killer`] and, on Unix, every other
//!   process of its session (herdr's session process list, [`crate::job::session_members`]), so a job-controlling
//!   shell's jobs in groups of their own are reached too; on Windows the child's job, its whole tree. A hangup, then
//!   a kill after [`KILL_GRACE`] or once the child, the PTY and the session's other processes ended (herdr's
//!   terminate step dropped), the child left unreaped meanwhile, so its group and its session, which its id names,
//!   are still reached once it exited and cannot be reused;
//! - a kill reports whether the program ended, in place of herdr's grace after the kill: its exit seen within
//!   [`TERMINATION_LIMIT`] of the first signal (a plain hangup on Unix, which the program may ignore, within
//!   [`KILL_LIMIT`]), then its end recorded, which waits for the PTY from the exit, so a slow exit (a loaded Windows
//!   takes half a second and more to end a job's tree) takes nothing of that wait;
//! - the registry is keyed by session name and drops a pane once its program ended.
//!
//! # The terminal
//!
//! Every read of the PTY is written into the pane's terminal and queued for each client under one lock, so the
//! terminal's state and the clients' streams agree at every offset; a client attaching later starts at the offset
//! the terminal had then. The terminal answers the program's queries itself, with the reply owner's facts; a clipboard
//! read stops the stream for the owner's answer, and the owner's terminal answers Kitty graphics commands, the
//! server's later answers waiting behind them ([`super::replies`]). Every answer is queued under that lock and written
//! by one thread ([`run_helper`]), so the program reads them in the order of its queries. The terminal loads no Kitty
//! images from files, temporary files or shared memory: an image shown that way is read once, by the client that shows
//! it, and places nothing on the server's terminal, whose cursor it does not move.
//!
//! # Snapshots
//!
//! That lock is the pane's one serialization point: the parsing, the output offsets, the clients' registration, the
//! lead and its resizes, and the snapshots ([`super::snapshot`]) all happen under it, so a snapshot is the terminal's
//! state at exactly the offset the client's output resumes at. Every client's first event (after its role, when it
//! is managed) is a [`ClientEvent::Snapshot`](super::clients::ClientEvent) opening its first epoch, normally 1 (an
//! overflow before it is sent drops it unsent, and the resync's opens the next): the creator's is empty, an attach's
//! holds the session's state, scrollback included. A snapshot needs a cut, which the terminal's
//! stream continuation gives; while the program stands inside a sequence too long to hand on, the attach waits for
//! one, up to [`PaneConfig::snapshot_wait`], while the PTY keeps being read, and then fails without having changed
//! anything ([`AttachError::Unavailable`]).
//!
//! A client whose queue overflowed ([`ClientEvent::Overflowed`](super::clients::ClientEvent)) is resynced in band
//! by [`Pane::resync`]: a new snapshot, led by [`super::snapshot::RESYNC_RESET`], in place of the output it was not
//! sent, opening its next epoch; it keeps its place in the lead. Past its [`ResyncBudget`], or without a cut in time,
//! it is detached instead, and its connection is closed. One that fell behind and was not resynced when the session
//! ends is sent the session's last snapshot ahead of its exit ([`super::snapshot::Kind::Last`]). Either snapshot
//! gives it back each clipboard's latest write it missed, the program's or printed ([`super::recovery`]).
//!
//! # Leadership
//!
//! Every client attaches with its grid and, when it is managed, its nonce and whether it claims the lead; its input
//! and its resizes go through [`Pane::input`] and [`Pane::resize_client`]. [`super::lead`] decides which of them owns
//! the session's size, and the pane applies the decision under the same lock: the leader's size, in order with the
//! output, then the managed clients' role reports ([`ClientEvent::Role`](super::clients::ClientEvent)). A client
//! detached, or whose subscription was dropped, leaves the lead as well, at once (dropping a subscription takes the
//! pane's lock). The program's end leaves no client attached or leading. [`Pane::write`] (typing on behalf of no
//! client) and [`Pane::resize`] (the server's own) bypass the lead.
//!
//! # On behalf of no client
//!
//! The api ([`super::api`]) reads and writes a session without attaching to it. [`Pane::observe`] reads its terminal
//! together with its revision ([`Pane::revision`]), which counts the changes of the terminal's screen: every read of
//! the PTY, every resize and every [`Pane::print`] moves it (zmx's `screen_revision`), nothing else does, so two reads
//! with the same revision saw the same screen. [`Pane::write`] queues typing that bypasses the lead, and
//! [`Pane::print`] writes bytes into the session's output as if its program had printed them (zmx's injected output,
//! for `ngtermctl clipboard set`'s OSC 52 write): the terminal and every client take them at the next offset, once the
//! program's output stands outside a sequence they could split.
//!
//! # The end
//!
//! When the program exits, the pane waits up to [`EXIT_GRACE`] for the PTY's end, so output written before the exit
//! reaches the terminal and every client first, then queues [`ClientEvent::Exit`](super::clients::ClientEvent) with
//! the program's code and signal (what `ngterm-term`'s `ExitPolicy` decides on) for every client and detaches them;
//! a client whose queue overflowed and was not resynced yet is sent the session's last snapshot before it. [`Panes`]
//! then forgets the session.
