//! The attach role: a connection that attaches to one session, creating it when asked, and carries its stream both
//! ways until the client detaches or goes, or the session ends.
//!
//! herdr: `src/server/client_transport.rs` (a reader and a writer per connection, the writer draining the client's
//! queue so the pane never waits for the socket) and `src/server/headless/bootstrap.rs` (`attach_terminal_client`: the
//! session found or created by name, the client registered, then its input and resizes) at `HERDR_REV`
//! (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License 2.0, modified: ngterm's raw attach stream
//! ([`crate::protocol::AttachServerMessage`]) in place of herdr's rendered frames, threads in place of tokio tasks,
//! and the in-band resync of a client that fell behind.
//!
//! # The stream
//!
//! The first message is [`AttachClientMessage::Attach`], within [`HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`] (on Unix). The session it names
//! is attached to, or created with its spec when it does not exist and the request carries one; otherwise the server
//! answers [`AttachServerMessage::Refused`] and closes. Then a writer thread sends the client's events in order:
//!
//! - each snapshot as `SnapshotBegin { epoch, offset, size }`, chunks of at most [`snapshot::CHUNK_SIZE`] bytes and
//!   `SnapshotEnd`;
//! - the output, size changes, role and reply-ownership changes and the requests delegated to it as they come, the
//!   output contiguous from the snapshot's offset;
//! - on an overflow, the client's resync ([`Pane::resync`]): a new snapshot under the next epoch. A client past its
//!   resync budget, or one no snapshot could be cut for in time, is detached and its connection closed. One that
//!   overflowed when the session ends is sent the session's last snapshot instead, ahead of its exit;
//! - the session's exit, after which the server closes the connection in order ([`endpoint::close`]): the client
//!   reads all that came before, the exit, then the connection's end, however late it reads them (on Windows the
//!   writer waits for that until the client closes or detaches).
//!
//! Meanwhile the connection's own thread reads the client's input, resizes, reply metadata, delegated answers
//! ([`Pane::answer`]) and its terminal's Kitty answers ([`Pane::complete`]), until it detaches or the connection ends;
//! either detaches it and closes the connection.
