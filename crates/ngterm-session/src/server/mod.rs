//! The session server of one namespace: `ngterm-session server <namespace directory>`, started on demand by the first
//! client that finds none ([`spawn::connect_or_start`]), detached from it, and stopped by itself once it holds no
//! session and no client ([`lifecycle`]).
//!
//! herdr: `src/server/headless/bootstrap.rs` (`run_server`: bind, then serve until stopped; a second server under a
//! taken endpoint gives up), `src/server/client_accept.rs` and `src/api/server.rs` (the accept loop and a thread per
//! connection) and `src/server/client_transport.rs` (`handle_client_handshake`: the hello read under a timeout before
//! anything else) at `HERDR_REV` (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License 2.0, modified. Kept: the
//! server owns its endpoint for its whole life, accepts on one thread, gives every connection a thread of its own that
//! starts with the handshake, and drops what it cannot serve. Changed: threads only, with the stop decided by a
//! coordinator waiting on [`lifecycle::Lifecycle`]'s deadline instead of herdr's tokio loop and stop flag; the
//! handshake is ngterm's stable control layer ([`crate::protocol`]); the server leaves its launcher's working
//! directory ([`working_directory`]); it reports whether it runs detached from its launcher
//! ([`CAPABILITY_DETACHED`], herdr's `detached_server_daemon` status) so the client that started it can check that
//! the server outlives it; and the coordinator also keeps the namespace's lock file current, at the start and hourly
//! ([`upkeep`], ngterm's addition after upstream agterm's #733).
//!
//! # Panes
//!
//! [`pane::Pane`] is one live session: its program on a PTY, the terminal its output builds and the clients that
//! output fans out to over byte-bounded, lossless queues ([`clients`]), with the client that owns its size chosen by
//! [`lead`], each client starting from a snapshot of the session ([`snapshot`]), its program's queries answered once,
//! by the server's terminal with the facts of the client that owns the replies ([`replies`]), a client that fell
//! behind given back the clipboard writes it missed ([`recovery`]); [`pane::Panes`] holds the server's by name. A session counts in the server's lifecycle from its creation until its program ends.
//!
//! # Connections
//!
//! A connection counts as a client from its accept until it closes. Every connection starts with a hello
//! ([`crate::protocol::Control::Hello`]) within [`HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`] (on Unix; Windows pipes take no timeout). The
//! server serves every role: an attach connection attaches to a session, creating it when asked, and carries its
//! stream ([`attach`]); an api connection asks what `SessionHost` and `ngtermctl clipboard set` need, request by
//! request ([`api`]); a control connection holds the server, and asks it to hand its sessions over to a server of
//! another build ([`handoff`]), which it takes when it advertises [`crate::protocol::CAPABILITY_HANDOFF_REQUEST`]. A
//! role this server does not know is refused with [`crate::protocol::ErrorCode::UnsupportedRole`].
//!
//! Every api and attach operation runs under the server's operation lock, shared, and only for a connection of the
//! current generation, the one it was admitted in at its accept (not at its hello, which may come after a handoff
//! began): an update handoff takes the lock exclusively and moves the generation on, so no operation decoded before
//! it runs after it.
//!
//! # The command
//!
//! [`command`] is what `ngterm-session server …` runs: `server <namespace directory>` serves the namespace;
//! `server <namespace directory> --handoff-import <channel> <token>` is an update handoff's replacement, which takes the
//! namespace's sessions and endpoint over from the server that started it ([`run_import`]).
