//! A pane's part in the update handoff ([`crate::server::handoff`]): held at a cut in the server that gives it, and
//! rebuilt from that cut, inert until the commit, in the server that takes it.
//!
//! herdr: `src/pane.rs` (`begin_handoff`, `duplicate_handoff_fd`, `handoff_runtime_state`, `preserve_for_handoff`,
//! `from_handoff_fd`, `assume_handoff_ownership`) and `src/handoff_runtime.rs` (`HandoffRuntimeState`) at `HERDR_REV`
//! (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License 2.0, modified: the terminal passes (libghostty-vt's binary
//! snapshot, or its formatter's VT restoration where the two servers' libghostty-vt differ; what neither carries is
//! below) in place of herdr's 8 KiB of history seeded into a fresh terminal; the replies not yet written pass too;
//! the cut is a freeze acknowledged by the replies' helper and fenced from the child's waiter; agent state, titles and
//! input state are herdr's own and not here.
//!
//! # The cut
//!
//! 1. [`Pane::freeze`]: the replies' helper finishes the batch it took and then neither writes nor ends anything; the
//!    child's waiter, should the program end now, publishes nothing until a thaw (a pane already ending is left out).
//! 2. [`Pane::quiesce`]: the PTY actor writes what it queued and stops; output a Windows actor read meanwhile goes
//!    into the terminal first, so the actor holds nothing.
//! 3. [`Pane::cut`]: a waiting clipboard read is denied and the Kitty barriers end, then the terminal's state, the
//!    output offset, the revision and the replies ready to be written are taken, all under the pane's lock.
//!
//! What the terminal's state leaves behind at this pin: neither encoding carries Kitty images, their placements or
//! glyph registrations (Ghostty's snapshot codec ignores them on capture, and the formatter has no extra for them,
//! as for attach: [`crate::server::replies`]), so re-placing an earlier image by its id fails in the server's
//! terminal after a handoff; and the formatter has no saved-cursor extra, so across a pin change a later restore
//! (`ESC 8`) puts the server's cursor at the default position, and its CPR and DSR answers and later snapshots follow
//! it until the program moves the cursor. Carrying them needs a libghostty-vt that exposes them.
//!
//! A rollback ([`Pane::resume`]) undoes the first two, the replies still queued; a commit ([`Pane::hand_over`])
//! releases the PTY and leaves the pane frozen, ending nothing when dropped.
//!
//! # The import
//!
//! [`Pane::import`] rebuilds the terminal from the cut, with no client and no reply owner, the replies queued first,
//! the PTY actor started quiesced over the handed-over PTY, and the helper and the waiter started frozen: nothing it
//! does can fail later. [`Pane::activate`], on the commit, makes the actor the PTY's owner and thaws the rest.
//!
//! On Unix the import drives the PTY first, a resize to the size it has (which signals nothing to the program). On
//! Windows it leaves the pseudoconsole alone: every `ResizePseudoConsole`, to the size it has too, makes conhost
//! repaint its viewport from its own buffer, over what [`Pane::print`] wrote into the session's terminal alone (in
//! the old server's too, should the handoff roll back); the handles' checks stand in for it (`handoff::windows`).
//!
//! On Unix the program is not a child of the server that took it (herdr's `ChildExitReason::Handoff`): its end is
//! the PTY's end or its pid no longer naming it (its start time, from the process table), and it ends as
//! [`ExitStatus::Unknown`]. On Windows the program's process handle passed too, so its exit code is read as before.
