//! The session server's build id: what a server reports in its welcome and a client compares with the build it would
//! start, to hand a running server's sessions over to that build (`crate::server::handoff`).
//!
//! The id is the hash of the staged `ngterm-session` binary, which the stager writes beside it once the binary is in
//! place, as `share/ngterm/`[`STAGED_FILE`] of the staged root (`bin/` holding the binary):
//!
//! ```text
//! <id>
//! binary <size in bytes> <modification time, nanoseconds since the Unix epoch>
//! ```
//!
//! The second line ties the id to the binary it was written for: a server reads the file once, at its start, and
//! takes the id only when its own executable has that size and modification time (on Linux also only when that path
//! names the running image, `/proc/self/exe`); a client takes it as the build it would start only on the same terms.
//! A binary replaced without its id written after it (an update caught halfway, a stager that does not keep to this)
//! then never passes as the old build: the server reports an unverified id that equals no other
//! ([`unverified`]), which can only cause a handoff to the staged build, never hide a stale one. The match is on
//! metadata, not content, so two different binaries of one size and one modification time to the nanosecond would
//! pass for each other: a stager that preserves timestamps (`install -p`, `cp -p`) must not be paired with
//! same-sized builds. Hashing the binary at run time would close that, at the cost of reading the whole binary at
//! every start (debug builds are about 100 MB).
//!
//! An executable with no staged id beside it (a cargo build run in place, as the tests do) reports [`UNSTAGED`], and a
//! client starting one expects no build: no handoff is ever started for it.
//!
//! A stager publishes the binary by renaming it into place, then the id file the same way (Task 25's `stage.sh`).
