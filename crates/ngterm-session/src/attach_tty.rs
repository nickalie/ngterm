//! `ngterm-session attach` as a terminal client: the terminal it runs in (the outer terminal) in raw mode while it is
//! attached, its size and size changes, its input, and what passes between the session and it.
//!
//! - [`Tty`]: standard input and output; when both are a terminal, raw mode (Unix: termios' raw mode; Windows: console
//!   VT input, as herdr's `client/input/windows_vti.rs` reads it, with `ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT` for size changes, and VT
//!   processing of the output in UTF-8), restored when it is dropped; the grid and, where the terminal reports them,
//!   its pixels; a reader thread for the input and a watcher for size changes (Unix: `SIGWINCH`; Windows: the
//!   console's window-size events), which report to the attach loop ([`TtyEvent`]).
//! - [`filter`]: the session's output with the queries the server answers taken out.
//! - [`input`]: the outer terminal's input split into the user's input, its answers, and the detach key.
//! - [`owner`]: the client's own sequences (role titles, its probe, fences) and its part as the session's reply owner.
//!
//! herdr: `src/client/terminal_setup.rs` (raw mode, the Windows console's VT input and its restore),
//! `src/client/input/windows_vti.rs` (`console_input_handle`, `windows_console_input_items`: console input records
//! read with `ReadConsoleInputW`) and `src/platform/mod.rs` (`watch_terminal_resize_signal`) at `HERDR_REV`
//! (`build/pins.env`), licensed under the Apache License 2.0, modified: the key records' characters are taken as the
//! VT bytes the console encodes (herdr maps them to its own key events), a window-size record is a size change, and
//! `SIGWINCH` wakes a watcher thread instead of setting a flag a render loop polls.
