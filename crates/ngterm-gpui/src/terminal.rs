//! One terminal: an `ngterm-term` pane drawn by GPUI, the core's [`ngterm_host::Surface`] over it, and the views that
//! show it (plan > Task 13; Technical Details > Frame, Surface).
//!
//! - [`Terminal`] (a GPUI entity) owns the pane's pump: one foreground task woken through a one-token channel by the
//!   pane's IO thread (`PaneConfig::wake`) and by the Surface. Each wake drains the pane's events (re-emitted as
//!   [`TerminalEvent::Pane`]), runs the queued work that needs the app (the clipboard, events), and notifies the views.
//! - [`Shared`] is the plain main-thread state the entity, its views and the [`TerminalSurface`] share: the pane once
//!   spawned, the live font size and cell metrics (computed synchronously through the app's text system, so the core
//!   reads the right font and cell size right after an action), the owner's scale factor and grid, the queued work.
//!   The Surface has no GPUI context (the core calls it inside main-loop tasks): what it cannot do without one is
//!   queued and the pump does it on the next foreground tick, after the core's task; binding actions are accepted for a
//!   realized terminal, as the GTK build's were.
//! - [`TerminalView`] (an entity per view) draws the pane's shared frame with its own row cache. The [`ViewRole::Owner`]
//!   view lays the grid out, starts the pane at its first nonzero size (deferred out of prepaint, as GTK creates its
//!   surface on a tick once the area has a size) and resizes it; a [`ViewRole::Viewer`] (the dashboard's second
//!   rendering) only draws, at its own font size, and never spawns, resizes or takes input.
//!
//! Teardown drops the pane (its child gets `SIGHUP`) and closes the pump, whatever views still hold the state.
//!
//! Input (plan > Task 14) is the owner view's: keys reach it from the app's keystroke interceptor
//! (`crate::keymap_dispatch`, after the window's keymap) and go through ghostty's binds to the encoder
//! (`keyboard.rs`, `input.rs`), the input method composes at the cursor, the mouse selects, reports or opens links
//! (`mouse.rs`, `links.rs`), and the pump answers a program's clipboard access under `clipboard-read`/`-write` and
//! the prompt (`clipboard.rs`).
