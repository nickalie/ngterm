//! Desktop notifications (upstream's `Notifications/NotificationManager.swift`, `notifications.md`; port of the GTK
//! build's `notifications.rs`, which posted through `GNotification`) over the freedesktop notification server
//! (`org.freedesktop.Notifications` on the session bus) through `zbus`.
//!
//! The core records each notification (the badge and the `notify` event) and queues its banner; this posts the queued
//! banners, each under its identity: `<windowID>:<sessionID>:<pane>` for a terminal's, `<windowID>:<sessionID>:notify`
//! for a `notify` (the session's control slot, upstream #772). A repeat in one slot replaces the last one
//! (`replaces_id`), so a pane's banner never replaces a note and a newer note does; a click on a banner (its `default`
//! action, `ActionInvoked`) reveals the pane that fired (the main pane for a note) and raises its window with the
//! activation token the server sent just before (`ActivationToken`), as `GNotification`'s `activate-action` carries
//! it. Withdrawals are the core's explicit clears, queued with the posts and applied in that order
//! (`CloseNotification`): when a pane of the session takes focus and after a successful swap, as upstream's
//! `clearDelivered` call sites. A clear withdraws every pane's identity of that window and session and the control
//! slot's; a session no open window holds gets none, so a closed window's banners stay clickable and reopen it. A banner the server closes (it
//! expired, the user dismissed it) is forgotten. The badge clears on its own path and leaves the banners.
//!
//! The server sees no sound: a batch that posts banners sounds the configured notification sound as the display's
//! alert (Linux has none of upstream's named sounds), through the status sounds' throttled bell
//! ([`crate::status_sound`]); the badge and the event never depend on it.
//!
//! The banners go out in order on one task ([`run`]) over one session-bus connection of its own, which is also where
//! the server's signals arrive (a server may send `ActivationToken` to the connection that posted the banner alone);
//! the task routes them to their banners by server id. Those ids are the server's own: before one is reused (a repeat's
//! `replaces_id`, a withdrawal) the task asks the bus who owns the server's name now, and a reply from another server
//! than the last one tells the same, so the ids a server that restarted handed out are forgotten, never sent to its
//! successor (which numbers its banners afresh).
