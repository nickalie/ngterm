//! gpui-kit's theme in the chrome's colors, so the library's widgets read as the window around them: the popup,
//! dropdown and context menus, the tooltips, the text fields, the switches, the sliders, the color pickers and the
//! scrollbars. The buttons are the app's own (`super::button`).
//!
//! The library paints from a theme of its own (`gpui_kit::component::Theme`), which `gpui_kit::init` leaves on its
//! light palette and nothing in it follows by itself. [`sync`] puts it on the chrome's side: dark when the chrome
//! reads dark (upstream's `GhosttyApp.terminalThemeIsDark`, which pins the AppKit-drawn chrome to the terminal theme's
//! brightness rather than the desktop's: [`ngterm_core::html::theme::is_dark`] over the washed sidebar background),
//! which loads the library's palette for that side, then sets the colors [`SLOTS`] lists from the chrome over it. It
//! runs with every chrome sync (`super::sync`), so a theme set or previewed, a config reload, a settings change and a
//! desktop light/dark flip all reach the widgets, and it rewrites the theme only when what it shows differs.
