//! The watch on `remotes.conf` (upstream's `RemotesWatcher` file sources; the GTK build's `remotes_watcher.rs` over
//! `gio::FileMonitor`), through `notify`'s recommended watcher (inotify on Linux, `FSEvents` on macOS,
//! `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows): the file, its nearest existing directory and, when the file is a symlink, the
//! nearest existing directory of every link target on the way to the real file. A change that touches the file or the
//! way to it re-arms the watches, so a directory created later, a symlink target recreated or re-pointed, and an
//! editor's replace-on-save are all seen, then runs the change handler, which reads the file again in the core
//! ([`ngterm_core::Core::refresh_remotes`]).
//!
//! - **One thread** owns the watcher: it takes the paths to follow and the watcher's events from one channel.
//! - **Debounced**: a burst of events (an editor's save is several) settles for [`DEBOUNCE`] after the last one, at most
//!   [`DEBOUNCE_CAP`] after the first, then the watches are re-armed and the handler runs once. Re-arming before the
//!   handler reads means a change after the re-arm is seen by the new watches and one before it by the read; upstream
//!   re-reads on every event, which the burst's last read equals.
//! - **Only changes count**: inotify also reports opens and reads (the core's own read of the file among them), which
//!   would loop; a rescan (a queue overflow) counts as a change.
//! - **Following** a path arms the watches and then runs the handler once, so a change between the caller's own read
//!   (the core's launch read, or its re-point to a new config directory) and the watch's start is not lost; the
//!   core's report rule (once per clean-to-broken change) keeps that read from repeating a banner.
//! - Paths are made absolute and normalized first, as the watcher reports them, so a relative or unnormalized config
//!   directory still matches its events.
