//! The main loop's state: the core, and the tasks that change it. Ported from `agterm-gtk/src/state.rs`; it grows task
//! by task (the windows and their decks since Task 18).
//!
//! RULE: every mutation runs as a main-loop task and ends with [`AppState::settle`], which lands the model's side
//! effects (the immediate saves and the events in the ring; the debounced saves, the soft closes' grace timers and the
//! windows' `tree.changed` debounces armed on the loop) and records what the frontend must do with the app context
//! ([`FrontendWork`]). Handlers never touch the state in place: they [`post`] a task. The loop's consumer runs each
//! task with the state, then brings the windows in line with the model (`windows.rs`, the GTK build's settle-time
//! windows sync) and lands the frontend work (`app.rs`).
