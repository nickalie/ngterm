//! The panel window's root (upstream's `QuickTerminalPanelContent`): the terminal on the terminal's own background,
//! clipped to a 12-point radius with upstream's faint white edge, over the transparent window, so the corners show
//! what is behind; `quick-terminal` is its element id, as upstream's accessibility identifier.
//!
//! Each window the panel opens gets a root of its own and a fresh owner view of the long-lived terminal (a view keeps
//! what it painted in its window's atlas); the terminal itself lives in [`super::QuickPanel`]. The root reports what
//! its window does to the model: holding the keyboard and losing it (a summoned panel's dismissal), the display it
//! landed on (the layer host's refit), the window manager's close request (a dismissal), and the window going without
//! the panel closing it (the compositor's `closed` on a layer surface whose output went away: a dismissal too).
