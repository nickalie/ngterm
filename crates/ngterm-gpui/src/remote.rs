//! The remote links' frontend side: retrying them now when the network comes back or the machine wakes (upstream's
//! `RemoteLinkObserver`, its path monitor and its screens-did-wake bridge; the GTK build's `remote.rs`, which read
//! gio's `NetworkMonitor` and logind's `PrepareForSleep` over `GLib`). The presentation bridge itself is frontend-neutral
//! ([`ngterm_app::remote`]); the core decides everything else ([`ngterm_core::remote::client`]).
//!
//! A backoff measured on the monotonic clock does not advance across a suspend, so without this a pane could keep
//! waiting for up to five minutes after a resume, or after the network came back.
//!
//! - **The seam**: a platform's sources report [`LinkEvent`]s from threads of their own: the network's reachability
//!   (every report, the first one being the state at start) and a resume from sleep. [`LinkRetries`] folds them into
//!   retries (a report of the network available after an earlier report retries, as upstream's path monitor does; a
//!   resume always does), each posting [`AppState::retry_remote_links`]. Nothing in the seam names GPUI or D-Bus, so
//!   macOS (`NWPathMonitor`, the wake notification) and Windows plug their own sources in beside Linux's.
//! - **Linux** ([`dbus`]): `NetworkManager` on the system bus, else the desktop portal's network monitor on the session
//!   bus, else the kernel's default routes over rtnetlink ([`routes`], gio's netlink monitor), else none, and the
//!   network reads as always reachable (logged): the links then retry on their backoff alone. The resume is logind's `PrepareForSleep(false)`; without logind there is none (logged).
//! - **Windows** ([`windows`]): the IP helper's connectivity hint, its first report the state at start; the resume
//!   from sleep, and the console display's wake (modern standby's), from the app's hidden window.
//! - **Elsewhere**: no source yet; the network reads as always reachable and no resume is reported (logged).
