//! The keymap's key monitor and the terminal's keys (upstream's `CustomCommandRunner` local key monitor plus the
//! menu's key equivalents; port of `agterm-gtk/src/keymap_dispatch.rs`).
//!
//! One GPUI keystroke interceptor for the whole app ([`init`]) sees every key press before GPUI's own bindings and
//! element listeners, in ngterm's resolution order (`ngterm_core::ghostty_config::binds`, Technical Details >
//! Keyboard): first the window's own keys (`window::intercept_key`: the Ctrl-Tab switcher, and the picker's, palette's
//! and search bar's fields handing their navigation keys to their panel, as the GTK build's capture-phase controllers
//! did, and an ask's editor handing its dialog keys to its dialog, `crate::ask_dialog::intercept_key`), then the keymap
//! in a registered window ([`register_window`]) — custom commands, the `map` alternatives, leaders timing out after
//! 1.5 s, a `--repeat` tail live until 0.5 s after its release, then the built-in menu chords (except
//! `toggle_fullscreen`'s after a half-typed leader, and `undo_close`'s while an HTML page holds the keyboard, which
//! keeps it for its own undo: upstream's 00fc83d) — then, when a terminal's own view holds the keyboard,
//! ghostty's binds and the key encoder (`crate::terminal`), or when an HTML page holds it, the page's engine
//! (`crate::html_overlay`). A key either takes stops there: GPUI's binding matcher and
//! pending-keystroke buffering never see it, and the platform's input handler does not type it again. A focused text
//! field (an element in an `Input` key context), an open prompt, an alert (`crate::modal`) or the Settings popup
//! (`crate::settings`) keeps every key, as the GTK build's text fields and dialogs did.
//!
//! A chord is the key's physical identity resolved per layout (`terminal::input::chord`). A consumed key's next press
//! reads as its autorepeat until its release, which reaches [`key_up`] from the window's (and the terminal's) key-up
//! listener; [`keyboard_left`] forgets them when no ngterm window holds the keyboard any more. The leader and repeat
//! timeouts are deadlines checked at the next key, which is when they matter. Matched chords fire as main-loop tasks
//! (`AppState::keymap_fired`); a custom command carries the terminal typed in, read now (its selection included), as
//! the keyboard may move before the task runs.
