//! [`MainLoop`] over GPUI's executors: control connections, the bus and the signal thread post tasks from their own
//! threads, and one foreground task runs them one at a time, in posting order, with the state the main thread owns.
//!
//! The posting side is a channel sender plus GPUI's background executor for the delayed tasks' timers; the
//! foreground executor is `!Send` and stays with the consumer ([`drive`]). A delayed task waits in a registry until
//! its timer fires, so [`GpuiMainLoop::close`] drops it (and whatever reply sender it holds) at once rather than at
//! its deadline.
