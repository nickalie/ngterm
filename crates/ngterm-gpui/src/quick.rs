//! The quick terminal panel (upstream's `QuickTerminalPanel` and `QuickTerminalController` in
//! `agterm/Views/QuickTerminal.swift`, `windows.md` > Quick terminal; port of the GTK build's `quick.rs`): one panel per
//! app, a window of its own that belongs to no ngterm window, holding one terminal with the quick-terminal environment
//! ([`pane_env::quick_terminal`]: no session, window or workspace ids).
//!
//! The core owns the state ([`Core::quick_visible`], [`Core::quick_zoomed`]) and the terminal's slot; this follows it
//! after every main-loop task ([`QuickPanel::sync`], from the windows' sync). The terminal is created on the first
//! show, in the active session's directory, and installed in the core; it lives here, not in a window, so hiding keeps
//! the shell alive, typable and readable (`quick.type`, `quick.text`). GPUI cannot hide a window on Linux, so hiding
//! removes the panel's window and showing opens a new one ([`view::QuickView`], with a fresh view of the terminal).
//! The shell exiting drops the panel with its terminal; the next show starts both afresh.
//!
//! Host ([`QuickHost`], chosen once per run, logged): on Wayland a wlr-layer-shell surface ([`host`]), so the panel
//! floats over every window on its output and is never tiled, as upstream's floating `NSPanel`; a compositor without
//! layer-shell (GNOME/Mutter, weston) refuses it, and the panel is an ordinary undecorated window from then on, as it is
//! on X11 (GPUI opens a layer surface there as a plain window, so the backend decides, not the open's error) and on
//! every other platform.
//!
//! Sizing: [`ngterm_core::quick_metrics::panel_size`] of the panel's display, on every show, so a settings change
//! lands on the next summon. The layer surface names no output as it comes on screen, so the compositor puts it on its
//! current one, usually the focused output (a Wayland client cannot read the pointer outside its own surfaces, so that
//! stands in for upstream's pointer-screen rule). It is framed against the frontmost ngterm window's display (else the
//! first) until the platform reports the display it landed on, then refitted there once by reopening it named on that
//! output ([`placement::refits_on_enter`]); the zoom (`surface.zoom --target quick`) reopens it too, anchored to every
//! edge of the output it is on, as upstream fills the screen's visible frame. The window host is sized and centered on
//! the frontmost ngterm window's display, and maximizes in place for the zoom. Display bounds are logical
//! (xdg-output's, GPUI patch `gpui-pre-linux` 0002), so a fractional-scale output frames the panel right.
//!
//! Losing the keyboard dismisses only a panel the user summoned ([`Core::quick_lost_focus`]); the window manager's
//! close request hides the panel, its shell kept, and so does the compositor closing the layer surface (its output
//! went away). While the panel holds the keyboard the decks keep their hands off focus ([`holds_keyboard`]). A removed
//! window reports no blur or deactivation, so a hide tells the terminal's program the focus left itself (the next
//! window's view continues its focus reports) and has the key monitor forget its consumed keys once no ngterm window
//! holds the keyboard.
