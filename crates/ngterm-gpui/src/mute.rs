//! The inactive-pane and backdrop mute (upstream's `paneDim`, `backdropWash` and `muteWashOpacity` in
//! `WindowContentView+Detail.swift` and `WindowContentView.swift`; ported from the GTK build's `mute.rs`): a
//! translucent wash of the background a terminal renders, so background pixels blend background to background and text
//! pixels text to background. The text fades and the background does not darken. One Appearance setting gives both
//! washes their strength, nothing at 0.
//!
//! The unfocused pane of a shown split takes the wash. So does a program overlay covering that pane, in the overlay's
//! own background; a page covering it takes none (a user override of upstream, which washes a page too). A floating program's backdrop washes the whole session behind it: the session default over the page,
//! then each laid-out pane's color over that pane, painted opaque and faded once as a group. While a backdrop washes
//! the page the pane wash stays off, since the two would stack to a stronger mute on one pane than on the other.
//!
//! A wash lies right above its pane's terminal (under the lead covers), or above the pane's overlay; neither takes the
//! pointer or the keyboard, so a click still focuses the pane under it. GPUI fades each primitive on its own rather
//! than a group, so the backdrop's regions are first flattened into disjoint rectangles ([`flatten`]), each painted in
//! the color on top there: fading those one by one equals fading the stack once.
