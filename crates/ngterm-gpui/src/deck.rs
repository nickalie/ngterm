//! The detail deck: every session of the window holds one page with its terminals, all mounted at once, and only the
//! selected one visible, hit-testable and focused (upstream's eager deck, `WindowContentView+Detail.swift`
//! `detailPane`; ported from the GTK build's `deck.rs`). A session made at runtime spawns its shell as soon as its
//! terminal is laid out; a restored one waits until it is first shown (the core's lazy restore,
//! `ngterm_core::commands::relaunch`).
//!
//! A page is created once and keeps its terminals' views: switching sessions is a visibility flip. A hidden page is
//! laid out under the shown one but not drawn ([`TerminalView::set_shown`]), so its terminals still start at their
//! size and follow it: a runtime session's shells run (the conformance harness's `wait_mounted` waits for a `noSelect`
//! session's `realized` too), while a dormant restored session's terminals wait for their seed until it wakes.
//! Sessions a soft close holds out of the tree keep their pages, hidden, until the close is final. A page goes once
//! its session is gone; closing the session already tore its terminals down. Inside a page the session's panes follow
//! [`crate::split`].
//!
//! The model moves keyboard focus only by what it says should hold it: the deck focuses the shown page's focused pane
//! whenever that pane (or the shown page) differs from what it last focused, which is how selecting a session,
//! `session.focus`, a swap or the scratch move the input. A terminal the user focuses reports back through
//! [`AppState::pane_focused`]. While the window's picker or GUI ask, an alert or a popover is up no terminal is given
//! the keyboard, and the shown terminal gets it back once it closes. A session's terminal ask that wants the keyboard
//! takes it in place of the terminal it covers ([`crate::ask_dialog`]), and gives it back once it ends.
//!
//! Over a page's panes lie its pane overlays and its program overlay ([`crate::overlay`]), then its HUD
//! ([`crate::hud`]) and, above that, its terminal ask. An overlay the layout gives the keyboard takes it in place of
//! the pane it covers, and gives it back once it goes.
//!
//! While the window's dashboard is open no page shows: the grid ([`crate::dashboard`]) covers the deck and hosts each
//! member pane's own terminal view in its cell, which its page then does not draw, and the grid's focus holds the
//! keyboard. Once it closes the member terminals go back to their pages at their own font size, and the shown page's
//! terminal takes the keyboard again.
//!
//! The plan of what to add, remove and show is a pure function of the model ([`plan`]), so it is testable without a
//! window.
//!
