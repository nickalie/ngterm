//! One window over one model window's store (upstream's `WindowContentView.swift`; ported from the GTK build's
//! `window.rs`): the deck under the window's chrome, titled after the active session, reporting its on-screen state for
//! `window.list`, its activation as frontmost (upstream's `WindowAccessor.reportFrontmost`) and its close (upstream's
//! window `willClose`), and applying the window commands' requests. [`crate::windows`] owns the set of them.
//!
//! The window's content is a column: the title bar (`titlebar.rs`), then the sidebar's place (Task 19) beside the
//! deck, all on the chrome's background (`chrome.rs`); a window the client decorates gets resize handles along its
//! free edges. Over it sit the window's modal layers ([`Layer`]), in the GTK build's order: the scrollback search bar, the
//! Settings popup, the GUI ask, the native picker, the command palette, the Ctrl-Tab switcher and the title bar's
//! popovers; each attaches its view to its layer ([`WindowView::set_layer`]), drawn over the whole window while
//! attached. The window's alerts ([`crate::modal`]) come above everything.
//!
//! The Settings popup ([`crate::settings`]) comes up over the window Settings… was asked from: centered over a dimmed
//! layer that takes every click, a click outside the panel closing it as Escape and its close button do. It takes the
//! keyboard when it opens and keeps it as a modal does (a GUI ask, a picker or the palette arriving over it takes it,
//! and gives it back to it once it goes; so does an alert, and so does a control inside it that held the keyboard and
//! is no longer drawn); once it closes the shown terminal has the keyboard back.
//!
//! The GUI ask ([`crate::ask_dialog`]) is the window's own: one comes up with the model's modal slot, takes the
//! keyboard, and is drawn over its anchor while the rest of the window takes no clicks. So is the native picker
//! ([`crate::picker`], the slot's other tenant) and, while this window draws it, the command palette
//! ([`crate::palette`]): a new one takes the keyboard. While a GUI ask, a picker, the palette, an alert or a popover
//! holds the keyboard the deck moves none; once it closes the window's sync gives the keyboard back to the shown
//! terminal (an alert or a popover closing posts that sync), and an alert closing over a picker, a palette or a GUI ask
//! gives it back to that. The scrollback search bar ([`crate::search`]) sits at the terminal area's top right and takes
//! the keyboard when it comes up unless a modal holds it; the search's end gives it back to the terminal. The Ctrl-Tab
//! switcher ([`crate::session_switcher`]) never takes it.
//!
//! The window's own keys come first ([`intercept_key`], which the key monitor runs ahead of the keymap, any field's
//! bindings and the terminal): Ctrl+Tab and a walk's Escape are the switcher's, and the picker's, the palette's and
//! the search bar's fields hand their navigation keys to their panel (upstream's `onKeyPress` handlers, the GTK
//! build's capture-phase controllers). Control going up ends a walk (the root's modifier listener).
