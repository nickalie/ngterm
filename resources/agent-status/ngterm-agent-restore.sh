#
# Installed by ngterm's Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks command. An ngterm extension beyond upstream, which
# ships this only as a cookbook recipe (claude-session-resume) and as the SessionStart-pin pattern in its skill.
#
# In rerun restore mode a pane re-runs its captured foreground argv, or its `session restore` pin. A bare `claude`
# argv comes back as a NEW conversation, and `claude --resume X` stays on X after /clear or /resume switched the
# process elsewhere. These hooks pin the LIVE conversation instead, on every session start (startup, resume, clear,
# compact, fork), so the next launch reattaches to the latest one:
#
#   claude --resume <session_id> || claude
#
# The fallback starts a fresh claude when the conversation cannot be resumed: Claude Code fires SessionStart before
# the first message, and a conversation that never got one is not resumable ("No conversation found"). Claude Code
# exits 0 when quit (/exit, Ctrl-C twice, Ctrl-D), so the fallback runs only on that failure or a crash.
#
# The pin is shell code typed into the pane's login shell (fish, bash, zsh or PowerShell 7 all take `a || b`),
# sticky and persisted, so only a strictly checked id goes into it: the payload's `session_id`, UUID-shaped, hex
# digits and dashes only. Anything else leaves the existing pin alone.
#
# What pins, and what clears: only the interactive CLI pins. A `claude -p` run (also one spawned by a tool call of
# the pane's interactive claude, which inherits its environment) and an Agent SDK run have CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT
# `sdk-cli`, `sdk-ts`, `sdk-py`, …: Claude Code rewrites an inherited `cli` to `sdk-cli` for a non-interactive run
# before any hook fires. A payload with an `agent_id` comes from inside a subagent. SessionEnd clears the pin only on
# a deliberate exit (reason `prompt_input_exit` or `logout`); a killed process (SIGHUP when ngterm quits) ends with
# `other`, and `clear` and `resume` are followed by a SessionStart that re-pins, so all three keep it.
#
# ngterm's chat view: the pane's agent record follows the conversation the same way. Each start and each end (whatever
# its reason) pipes the payload to `ngtermctl agent hook claude SessionStart|SessionEnd`, under the same guards: the
# start sets the record, the end clears it when it names the record's conversation.
#
# As a hook it must never disturb the agent: no output (Claude Code adds a SessionStart hook's stdout to the
# conversation), always exit 0, and outside ngterm (NGTERM_SESSION_ID unset) it does nothing. It needs no jq or
# python: the payload is matched with bash's own regex.
#
# ngtermctl resolution: $NGTERMCTL, else the path the installer bakes in, else `ngtermctl` on PATH.
