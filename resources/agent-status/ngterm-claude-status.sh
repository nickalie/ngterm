# Claude Code status adapter installed by ngterm's Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks command.
#
# A worker agent spawned from inside a session (headless `claude -p` from a tool call, a second CLI
# agent) inherits the spawner's NGTERM_* environment, so its own hooks would repaint the SPAWNER's
# row. This adapter keeps that ownership question inside the installed hook package: decide from
# process topology, not terminal state. The hook is a descendant of the agent that fired it, so
# exactly one agent between here and the pane means "I am the pane's agent"; a second one means
# another agent spawned mine, so stay silent. A consecutive run of one name counts once, because a
# launcher that runs the real binary without `exec` leaves one agent wearing several pids. A worker
# is therefore caught only when a surviving process, such as its tool call's shell, separates it
# from a same-name spawner. A direct child is accepted as reporting: a hook whose whole command is
# `claude -p ...` runs through `sh -c`, which execs it, and that worker repaints the owner's row.
# A tty test cannot answer this — a headless lane that legitimately owns its pane has none, and a
# worker under script/expect gets a fresh pty anyway.
#
# It fails OPEN (reports) whenever the chain is unreadable or severed, e.g. a detached worker whose
# spawner already exited: a missed guard is the behavior without this adapter, while a false silence
# is a bug with no symptom. The argv is forwarded to the shared wrapper verbatim, with one exception:
#
# A turn can end with work still in flight, a background shell, subagent or monitor that wakes the
# agent again when it is done. Claude Code's Stop payload lists that work in `background_tasks` (empty
# when nothing is in flight), so a Stop that would post `completed` posts `active --blink` instead and
# the row keeps pulsing until a Stop with nothing in flight, or the SessionEnd hook the installer adds
# when the agent quits first. Upstream's stock Stop goes green at once and covers this case only in its
# truthful-agent-lights cookbook recipe. Only a `completed` call reads
# stdin, where Claude Code writes the payload as JSON; a key quoted inside a string value is escaped
# (`\"background_tasks\"`), so the match cannot hit the last assistant message.
#
# ngterm's chat view (an ngterm extension): `UserPromptSubmit` and `PermissionRequest` also report to the pane's agent
# record, piping the payload to `ngtermctl agent hook claude <event>` ahead of the status. Their state does not name
# the event (`PostToolUse` posts `active` too), so an `active` or `blocked` call reads the payload's head for its
# `hook_event_name`, and only those two events read the rest: a `PostToolUse` payload, which can hold a whole tool
# output, stays unread. Only the interactive CLI reports (a `claude -p` worker runs with CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT
# `sdk-cli`, besides the walk above), and a subagent's prompt (`agent_id`) never does; a subagent's permission prompt
# does, and `agent hook` keeps only the prompt of it.

# exact names, not a glob: `claude*` also matches wrapper scripts such as claude-opus-worker.
# The list is the union of the hook-driven agents and shell/integration.sh's NGTERM_AGENT_RE
# default — one agent set split by detection mechanism, and the walk must count all of it: an
# integration-driven agent (say gemini) that spawns `claude -p` is a spawner too, and missing it
# here would let the worker's reset repaint the gemini pane. Keep the two lists in sync.
#
# An overridden NGTERM_AGENT_RE (integration.sh documents the export) extends the set beyond the
# literals, matched against the same argv[0] basename the literal list sees — not the typed command
# line the shell integration matched, so an override that inspects arguments won't extend the walk.
# The expression is evaluated as ERE; zsh under RE_MATCH_PCRE and fish read the same value as PCRE,
# so an override can be valid there and invalid here. `[[` then returns 2, which lands on "not an
# agent" and keeps the walk fail-open; the redirect swallows bash's complaint about the expression.
