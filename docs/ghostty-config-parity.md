# Ghostty config keys the GPUI build ignores

**Deferred with the user's sign-off on 2026-10-17** («Давай отложим эти ключи», the Task 35 review of
`docs/plans/20261014-gpui-frontend.md`). Work item: [docs/backlog/implement-deferred-ghostty-config-keys.md](backlog/implement-deferred-ghostty-config-keys.md).

This is a living list: when a key gets implemented, take its row out (and the backlog item out with the last one).

## What "ignored" means

The GPUI build parses Ghostty's config itself (`crates/ngterm-core/src/ghostty_config/`). Every key Ghostty knows at
`LIBGHOSTTY_VT_REV` is accepted, and its value is checked as libghostty checks it, so `config.reload` counts the same
diagnostics. The typed model (`GhosttyConfig`, `model.rs`) carries only a subset of the keys. The keys below reach the
"ghostty config key not supported; ignored" arms of `GhosttyConfig::apply` (logged at debug level) and change nothing.
A user who sets one gets Ghostty's default behavior, or ngterm's own behavior where ngterm owns the feature.

147 keys are in that state. The list comes from the key table itself: each key in `known_keys()` was applied to a
default `GhosttyConfig`, and the keys the model refused were collected. Three more keys miss the model but are read
elsewhere, so they are not listed: `keybind` (`binds.rs`), `config-file` (the loader's includes) and `command`
(`ngterm-gpui` `session_host.rs`, a pane's default program).

## How the GTK build was judged

The removed GTK build (last at `f3c0f93`, `crates/agterm-gtk`, `crates/ngterm-ghostty`) embedded the full libghostty
at Ghostty `683d8db` through its embedded apprt (`apprt/embedded.zig`). It did not use Ghostty's own GTK app runtime.
A key's consumer in Ghostty's source at `683d8db` therefore decides whether the GTK build honored it:

- **core** (`Surface.zig`, `termio/Termio.zig`, `renderer/generic.zig`, `renderer/OpenGL.zig`, `renderer/Thread.zig`,
  `font/SharedGridSet.zig`): libghostty applied it to every surface, so the GTK build honored it on Linux, unless
  the code is gated to macOS.
- **GTK apprt** (`apprt/gtk/...`) or Ghostty's macOS app: Ghostty's own app runtimes, which the GTK build did not run.
  The key had no effect there, unless `agterm-gtk` read it itself. It read only `font-size`, `background`,
  `foreground`, `palette`, `cursor-opacity`, `cursor-style-blink`, `mouse-hide-while-typing`,
  `shell-integration-features` and `title` (`ngterm-ghostty` `config::keys`), and none of them is listed here.
- **an apprt action from core** (`command_finished`, `mouse_over_link`, `initial_size`, `toggle_fullscreen`,
  `needs_confirm_quit`): it counted only where the GTK build handled that action. `ngterm-ghostty`'s `Action` enum
  handled `Render`, `SetTitle`, `Pwd`, `CellSize`, `DesktopNotification`, `ShowChildExited`, the search actions,
  `ConfigChange`, `MouseShape`, `MouseVisibility`, `OpenUrl`, `ColorChange` and `RingBell`. Every other action
  arrived as `Other` and was dropped.

Upstream macOS agterm also embeds libghostty, so its status matches the GTK build's, except for keys gated to macOS.
Those keys are marked "macOS" below: libghostty honors them on upstream's platform, and they matter to a macOS port of
this build, not to Linux.

| category | keys | status |
|---|---:|---|
| honored by the GTK build | 49 | deferred work (the backlog item) |
| macOS only | 31 | no Linux meaning; revisit with a macOS port |
| Ghostty app-runtime keys the GTK build did not honor | 64 | not a parity gap; ngterm owns the UI they shape |
| not in the GTK build's Ghostty (new at the pin) | 3 | not a parity gap |
| CLI only | 1 | no effect in a config file, in Ghostty too |

## 2. macOS only (31)

These keys are gated to macOS in libghostty or read only by Ghostty's macOS app. The GTK build could not honor them;
upstream macOS agterm gets the libghostty-gated ones (`macos-option-as-alt`, `font-thicken*`, `window-colorspace`,
`window-vsync`, `background-blur`) from libghostty.

| key | Ghostty meaning | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `macos-option-as-alt` | treat Option as Alt | `Surface.zig` passes it to the key encoder, which applies it on macOS |
| `macos-non-native-fullscreen` | fullscreen without a new Space | `Surface.zig` → `toggle_fullscreen`, macOS app |
| `macos-titlebar-style` | native, transparent, tabs or hidden titlebar | macOS app |

| `macos-icon-ghost-color` | the color of the ghost in the icon | macOS app |
| `macos-icon-screen-color` | the color of the screen in the icon | macOS app |
| `font-thicken` | draw glyphs thicker | `renderer/generic.zig` passes it to CoreText; `font/face/freetype.zig` has no thicken ("currently only supported on macOS") |
| `font-thicken-strength` | how much thicker | as `font-thicken` |
| `window-colorspace` | sRGB or Display P3 | `renderer/generic.zig` (`use_display_p3`, Metal); "only supported on macOS" |
| `window-vsync` | draw on the display link | `renderer/generic.zig` `syncDisplayLink` (CoreVideo); "only supported currently on macOS" |
| `background-blur` | blur behind a translucent background | `renderer/generic.zig` (`comptime builtin.os.tag == .macos`), `apprt/embedded.zig` (`ghostty_set_window_background_blur`). On Linux both builds blur from ngterm's own Settings (`background_blur`) |
| `auto-update` | check for updates | macOS app (Sparkle) |
| `auto-update-channel` | stable or tip updates | macOS app |
| `undo-timeout` | how long a closed window can be undone | macOS app ("Linux doesn't support undo operations") |

| `window-step-resize` | resize in cell steps | macOS app |
| `quick-terminal-animation-duration` | the quick terminal's slide animation | macOS app ("only implemented on macOS") |
| `quick-terminal-space-behavior` | the quick terminal across Spaces | macOS app |

## 3. Ghostty app-runtime keys the GTK build did not honor (63)

Ghostty's own GTK app runtime (or both of its runtimes) reads these keys. The GTK build ran the embedded runtime, and
`agterm-gtk` did not read them, so setting them changed nothing there either. Several of them shape UI that ngterm
draws itself, after upstream: windows, titlebar, sidebar, splits, quick terminal, palette, notifications.

| key | Ghostty meaning | evidence (Ghostty `683d8db`) |
|---|---|---|
| `gtk-custom-css` | extra GTK CSS | `apprt/gtk/class/application.zig` |
| `gtk-horizontal-tab-scroll` | scroll the tab bar horizontally | `apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig` |

| `bell-features` | what the bell does (system sound, audio file, attention, title, border) | `apprt/gtk/class/{application,surface,window}.zig`; the GTK build handled `RingBell` its own way |
| `bell-audio-path` | the bell's audio file | `apprt/gtk/class/application.zig` |
| `bell-audio-volume` | the bell's volume | `apprt/gtk/class/application.zig` |
| `progress-style` | show OSC 9;4 progress as a bar | `apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig`; ngterm draws its own progress |
| `resize-overlay` | show the grid size while resizing | `apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig` |
| `resize-overlay-position` | where it shows | `apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig` |
| `resize-overlay-duration` | how long it shows | `apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig` |
| `scrollbar` | show a scrollbar | Ghostty app runtimes |
| `drag-handle` | the split drag handle | `apprt/gtk/class/surface.zig` |
| `unfocused-split-opacity` | dim unfocused splits | `apprt/gtk/class/application.zig`, macOS app (`config/CApi.zig`) |

| `window-inherit-working-directory` | a new window starts in its parent's directory | as above |
| `window-inherit-font-size` | a new surface takes its parent's font size | `apprt/embedded.zig` with a parent surface; the GTK build created none (session zoom is ngterm's) |
| `window-decoration` | client, server or no decorations | `apprt/gtk/class/window.zig`; ngterm draws its own chrome |
| `window-theme` | the window's light/dark theme | `apprt/gtk/class/{application,window}.zig` |

| `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` | wait before quitting | as above |
| `quick-terminal-position` | the quick terminal's edge | Ghostty app runtimes; ngterm's quick terminal has its own placement |
| `quick-terminal-size` | its size | Ghostty app runtimes |

| `notify-on-command-finish` | notify when a long command finishes | `Surface.zig` → `command_finished` action, which the GTK build dropped |
| `notify-on-command-finish-action` | bell and/or notification | as above |
| `notify-on-command-finish-after` | the minimum command duration | as above |
| `link-previews` | show a hovered link's target | `Surface.zig` → `mouse_over_link` action, which the GTK build dropped |

## 4. Not in the GTK build's Ghostty (3)

Ghostty added these keys after `683d8db`. At `LIBGHOSTTY_VT_REV` they are core features (`Surface.zig`,
`termio/Termio.zig`), but neither the GTK build nor upstream v0.36.0 (also `683d8db`) had them.

| key | Ghostty meaning |
|---|---|
| `vt-window-resize-allowed` | whether a program may resize the window (CSI 8 t) |
| `vt-xt-checksum-report` | whether DECRQCRA (rectangle checksum) is answered |
| `vt-xt-checksum-extension` | XTerm's checksum extension flags |

## 5. CLI only (1)

| key | Ghostty meaning |
|---|---|
| `config-default-files` | load the default config files; "can only be set via CLI arguments", so a config line has no effect in Ghostty either |
