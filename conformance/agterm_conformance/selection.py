"""`--ratchet-only`: run just the ids a ratchet list holds, plus the extra selections a task names.

A full run of the Rust build waits out every read-back a red test makes (a build short of parity has hundreds), so a
task's routine check runs only what its ratchet already holds, plus what it is working on (`--also` a path or node-id
prefix, `--also-k` a `-k` expression), and judges the ratchet exactly as a full run does. The nodeid report then says
`"mode": "ratchet-only"`: `check_ratchet.py` judges every listed id, warns about a listed id that was not collected,
and adds only ids that ran and passed. A full run stays the default and is required at milestones
(conformance/README.md > Rust runner and ratchet).
