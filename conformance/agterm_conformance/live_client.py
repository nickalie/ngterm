"""A second client of one of the Rust build's live sessions: the local stand-in for a viewer attached over ssh.

The Rust build's counterpart of `zmx_client.leading_client`: its sessions run in one session server per instance
(`ngterm-session`), so the viewer is `ngterm-session attach`, started as `ngterm_core::remote::ssh::attach_command`
starts the viewer's on the origin, minus ssh: the attach contract's variables (`NGTERM_LIVE_*`, empty meaning unset),
explicit leadership claimed, and the create-only guard after the session's name.
