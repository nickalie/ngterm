# What a Rust build must implement for the suite

## `version` extension

`version` is the harness's readiness probe: it is polled until it answers, and an error reply fails the launch.
Its result is the reference's `app` block and its optional `installed` block, plus a `conformance` block only the
Rust build reports, and no other key (`assert_version_result` in `agterm_conformance/match.py`):

```json
{"app": {"version": "0.1.0", "commit": "abc1234"},
 "installed": {"version": "0.1.0", "commit": "abc1234"},
 "conformance": {"parityLevel": "0.38.1", "capabilities": ["posix-shell", "live-sessions"]}}
```

- `app.version`: a non-empty string; `app.commit` is optional, and the CLI's `version` prints `version (commit)`.
  `tree` carries the same object as `tree.app`.
- `installed`: the same two values read at request time from the install the app was started from (upstream's bundle
  `Info.plist`; the Rust build's staged `share/ngterm/app-BUILD`, or the bundle's plist inside a macOS app bundle),
  absent when they cannot be read. The CLI's `version` prints an `installed:` line only when it differs from `app`. It
  is not on `tree`. Its tests rewrite the file of a private install the adapter lays out
  (`launch(private_install=True)`, `Adapter.write_installed`).
- `conformance.parityLevel`: the upstream version whose behavior the build claims, a dotted version with an optional
  `v` (no suffix such as `-beta`).
  A test marked `since(V)` above it skips as `not-yet-at-level`.
  The Rust build claims `0.38.1` (`PARITY_LEVEL` in `ngterm-proto`), the release the catalog describes: it was
  raised once the port of v0.37.0 to v0.38.1 had landed, never ahead of it, so every `since` test runs against it.
- `conformance.capabilities`: names from the vocabulary below; a test whose `requires` names one missing skips as
  `unsupported`.
  Names outside the vocabulary match nothing.
- A missing `conformance` block, or a run without `--bin`, puts the build below every level: every test skips and
  parity reads 0%.
  A malformed block fails the launch.
- The profile is read once per run, from the first instance launched, or from a probe launch.

## Launch contract

The harness execs the binary with:

- `HOME`, `XDG_{CONFIG,DATA,STATE,CACHE}_HOME`, `NGTERM_STATE_DIR` and `NGTERM_CONTROL_SOCKET` under a fresh
  `/tmp/agt-*` root; the build binds the control socket at `NGTERM_CONTROL_SOCKET` (under 104 bytes);
- on Linux, a unique `NGTERM_APP_ID` it must use as its application id, a private `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and
  `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` naming the instance's own headless weston and bus;
- `SHELL=/bin/sh`, `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, and `<state>/config/ghostty.conf` holding `command = /bin/sh`,
  `copy-on-select = false` and `clipboard-write = deny`;
- `<state>/windows` present, which skips the first-run welcome, and `<state>/settings.json` when a test seeds settings.

The Rust build (GPUI) gets, on top of that:

- `VK_DRIVER_FILES` (and `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`) naming lavapipe's ICD manifest alone, `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`,
  Mesa's EGL vendor, and no inherited `VK_*`, `WGPU_*`, `__NV_*`, `__GLX_*`, `DRI_PRIME` or `MESA_LOADER_*`: it renders
  on lavapipe and llvmpipe only, never on the machine's GPU driver, and a launch without lavapipe fails;
- a headless weston started with `--fake-seat`, since GPUI needs a `wl_seat`: weston 15.0 or later (the system's, or
  the one `scripts/build-weston.sh` vendors where the system's is older).

On Windows (`tools/run-windows.sh`) the launch differs where the OS does:

- the control socket's path is the identity, and the build serves the named pipe it names
  (`ngterm_core::paths::control_pipe_name`; `agterm_conformance/transport.py` derives the same name);
- `LOCALAPPDATA` and `APPDATA` lie under the root with `HOME`, a unique `NGTERM_APP_ID` names the single instance, and
  the live-session namespace is `<LOCALAPPDATA>\ngterm\live\<hash>` over the state dir's realpath
  (`live_socket_directory`), its server `ngterm-session.exe server <that dir>`;
- no `SHELL`; `PATH` is the system directories alone (`System32`, the Windows directory, `Wbem`), so the login shell
  is the inbox Windows PowerShell; the ghostty config's `command` is Git for Windows' `sh.exe` (absolute) in place of
  `/bin/sh`;
- no compositor, bus or lavapipe: the build renders through DirectX on the machine's adapter;
- the quit is the session's end (the Restart Manager's `WM_QUERYENDSESSION`, then `WM_ENDSESSION` with
  `ENDSESSION_CLOSEAPP`) posted to the build's hidden `ngterm-system-window`, which must quit within the same 10
  seconds; the app's process tree is then ended by pid, and the Job object holding the app's processes is closed.

SIGTERM must quit without a prompt within 10 seconds.
Live sessions keep their sockets in a namespace directory named by the FNV-1a 64 hash (`%016x`, lowercase hex) over
the UTF-8 bytes of the state dir's realpath, with a leading `/private` dropped on macOS when the shorter path exists:
upstream's zmx sockets in `/tmp/agterm-zmx-<hash>` (`upstream_socket_directory` in
`agterm_conformance/vocabulary.py`), the Rust build's session server in `/tmp/ngterm-live-<hash>`
(`live_socket_directory`); the adapter's vocabulary names it, prefixed with the adapter's `app_dir_name` (the
instance's `live_dir`). Every zmx or session-host process of the reference carries `ZMX_DIR=<that dir>`; the Rust
build's one server per instance runs as `ngterm-session server <that dir>`, and its sessions' programs and their
attach clients carry `NGTERM_LIVE_DIR=<that dir>`. One left running after the stop fails it (the server gets its idle
grace to stop by itself once its sessions are reaped).
The CLI (`agtermctl` for the Swift build, `ngtermctl` for the Rust one: `Adapter.ctl_name`) is taken from `--ctl`,
else from beside `--bin`.

## Capability vocabulary

Source of truth: `CAPABILITIES` in `agterm_conformance/impls/base.py`; `selftests/test_docs.py` keeps this table equal
to it and to the reference's profile. `host`: claimed only where the account's login shell is zsh or fish.
A row with the reference column empty and a meaning starting `Rust-only` is an extension of the Rust build, see
Rust-only extensions below.
A capability names a divergence the platforms legitimately differ in; behavior both the reference and the Rust build
share is asserted directly, with no capability.

| capability | swift-macos | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `posix-shell` | yes | panes run /bin/sh, so `session type` + `session.text` round-trips are deterministic |
| `live-sessions` | host | restoreMode live keeps panes in live sessions that outlive the app (upstream's zmx daemons; the Rust build's one session server per instance, ngterm-session) |
| `live-any-shell` |  | Rust-only: Live sessions in a bash or PowerShell login shell as well as upstream's zsh and fish, each started with its shell integration (Ghostty's, ngterm's own for PowerShell); claimed where the password-database login shell is one of them and ngterm-session is staged |
| `window-geometry` | yes | window x/y position is settable through `window.move`, read back as `geometry` and restored |
| `window-minimize` | yes | `window.minimize` and `window.new --minimized` take effect and read back as `minimized` |
| `sidebar-min-width` | yes | `sidebar.width` narrows the sidebar down to the 160-point floor and reads that back |
| `hidden-split-holds-focus` |  | `session.focus` on a hidden split reads back as `splitFocused`; upstream's shown left pane takes the focus back while its window is key |
| `posix-command-line` | yes | a command line (an overlay's program, a scratch pane's command, a hook, a custom command) runs through `/bin/sh -c`, so a test's POSIX line runs as written; Windows runs it through `cmd.exe` |
| `cmd-command-line` |  | Rust-only, Windows: a command line (an overlay's program, a scratch pane's command, a hook, a custom command) runs as `cmd.exe`'s command text (`%ComSpec% /D /S /C`), so a test's `cmd` line runs as written where `posix-command-line` is not claimed |
| `untitled-panes` | yes | a pane has no title until a program sets one; Windows' console host titles each pane with its program's path |
| `windows-shells` |  | Rust-only, Windows: a pane runs PowerShell or `cmd.exe` as its shell (the config's `command`), and a rerun restore types a captured program's replay, and a pinned line, as that shell reads them |

## Rust target profile

The capabilities the Rust build claims are held to upstream's contract: the build takes upstream's branch of every
capability whose behavior lives in upstream's own code, and claims each one in the task that implements its command,
never ahead of it. It claims (`CAPABILITIES` in `ngterm-gpui`'s `app.rs`, plus the live ones by host):

- `posix-shell`: panes run `/bin/sh` from the harness's ghostty config, as the reference;
- `hidden-split-holds-focus`: upstream's documented model contract (`control-api.md`, "works shown or hidden; read
  `splitFocused`", and `AppStorePaneTests`); macOS's reversion is an AppKit first-responder effect;
- `posix-command-line`, `untitled-panes`: on Linux and macOS, as upstream; not on Windows (below);
- `cmd-command-line`: on Windows, where a command line (an overlay's program, a scratch pane's command, a hook, a
  custom command) is `cmd`'s (below);
- `windows-shells`: on Windows, where a pane's shell may be PowerShell or `cmd.exe` and a rerun restore types its
  replay quoted for that shell (`ngterm-core`'s `shell_dialect`; the harness picks the shell with
  `launch(pane_shell=...)`), where upstream types a POSIX line into any shell;
- `live-sessions`: by host, where the login shell is zsh or fish (upstream's two) and `ngterm-session` is staged;
- `live-any-shell`: by host, live sessions for bash and PowerShell login shells too, the one Rust-only extension
  (below): claimed together with `live-sessions` for a zsh or fish login shell, alone for the others.

It does not claim:

- `window-geometry`, `window-minimize`: Wayland gives a client no window position and no minimized read-back; their
  tests branch, and the Rust build passes the other branch;
- `sidebar-min-width`: the GPUI frontend does not claim it; its test takes the other branch.
- on Windows, `posix-command-line`: a command line runs as `cmd.exe`'s command text there (`%ComSpec% /D /S /C`, as
  Ghostty runs a command on Windows; `ngterm-host`'s `command_line` chooses it for every caller), so the tests of
  hooks, custom commands, overlay programs and scratch commands take their `cmd` branch instead (`cmd-command-line`,
  claimed on Windows only, with `agterm_conformance.command_line` building each line in either dialect), and the few
  whose lines have no `cmd` form skip as unsupported; and `untitled-panes`: the console host
  (ConPTY) titles a pane with its program's path before any program sets one, so the title test reads that title on
  the other branch.
- on Windows a pane's `foreground` and `foregroundShell` come from a stand-in for the console's foreground (the
  oldest program its job runs, `ngterm-session`'s `console_foreground`), and a foreground argv's `argv[0]` is the
  program as its parent started it (an MSYS shell's programs by their image's full path); the suite compares it by
  the program's name (`match.program_argv`), with no capability, since the reference never runs on Windows.

The table above stays the reference's profile; this list is the Rust build's.

Restore is lazy, unlike upstream's eager deck (the user's call, 2026-10-19): only each window's selected restored
session spawns at launch, the others once shown or once a command needs their terminal. No capability marks it: the
suite already waits for a restored session only once it is selected.

Ghostty config keys mean what Ghostty at `LIBGHOSTTY_VT_REV` makes of them, not upstream's older libghostty. Where
the two differ the build follows the pin: `copy-on-select = clipboard`, both clipboards in upstream's libghostty
(upstream's docs give it for a selection on the system clipboard "as well"), is the system clipboard only, the
selection clipboard untouched (`both` is upstream's meaning); an explicit `copy-on-select = true`, upstream's
selection pasteboard on macOS, goes through Ghostty's compatibility handler, the selection clipboard on Linux and the
system clipboard only on macOS and Windows (README > The selection clipboard). No capability marks it: the harness's
ghostty config sets `copy-on-select = false`.

## Rust-only extensions

A Rust-only extension is a capability the reference does not claim, so its tests (`requires` on it) skip as
`unsupported` on the reference and the reference discipline holds them to nothing there: the Rust CI validates them
instead, with `--must-pass` on the capability in every job whose host can claim it.
Today there is one, `live-any-shell`: a Live pane runs the password database's login shell in its live session, zsh
and fish as upstream, bash and PowerShell as well, each started with its shell integration the way libghostty starts a
shell it spawns itself (`ZDOTDIR` for zsh, `ENV` in POSIX mode for bash, `XDG_DATA_DIRS` for fish, the integration's
root merged in front of the pane's own value as upstream; ngterm's own script for PowerShell, which Ghostty does not
integrate).
Its tests are in `tests/protocol/test_live_any_shell.py`; a test that branches on Live being active
(`test_restore.py::test_seeded_live_mode_is_requested_at_launch`) takes the fallback branch only when the build has
neither `live-sessions` nor `live-any-shell`.
The `conformance` job of `.github/workflows/rust-linux.yml` is a matrix over three login shells, each leg with
`--must-pass live-any-shell`: bash, fish and zsh. The zsh and fish legs, the hosts where the build claims
`live-sessions`, also run with `--must-pass live-sessions`, as reference-macos.
No leg runs a PowerShell login shell, so the suite does not hold PowerShell's part of the claim: below it,
`.github/workflows/cross-platform.yml` runs `ngterm-session`'s PowerShell session tests (`tests/pwsh.rs`: the
integration's marks and working directory, the foreground read, a replay) on Linux, macOS and Windows, and
`ngterm-core`'s replay round trip through a real `pwsh` where one is installed.

## The `live` group

The Rust build answers upstream's control-protocol group `zmx.*` as `live.*`, a deliberate deviation from upstream: no
`zmx` in its code, its control protocol or its CLI, and the session server (`ngterm-session`) in place of zmx itself. An upstream
Mac and this build can therefore no longer view each other's sessions (`live.tree HOST` runs `ngtermctl live tree` on
the far side, an attached row's stream `ngtermctl live present`), and neither can this build and a Rust build from
before the rename.

| upstream | Rust build |
|---|---|
| `zmx.list`, `zmx.prune`, `zmx.kill`, `zmx.reset`, `zmx.tree`, `zmx.attach`, `zmx.present`, `zmx.screen` | `live.list`, `live.prune`, `live.kill`, `live.reset`, `live.tree`, `live.attach`, `live.present`, `live.screen` |
| `agtermctl zmx <subcommand>` | `ngtermctl live <subcommand>` |
| `result.zmx` (the inventory) | `result.live` |
| `tree.session.backedByZmx`, `surfaces[].backedByZmx` | `backedByLive` |
| `AGTERM_UITEST_ENABLE_ZMX` | `NGTERM_UITEST_ENABLE_LIVE` |

Every other field, every semantic and every error string that names no zmx is upstream's. The strings that named zmx:

| upstream | Rust build |
|---|---|
| `zmx.kill requires an explicit --target`, `… requires --pane left\|right`, `… requires --force`, `… needs a session id; 'active' is not accepted`, `… needs a window id; 'active' is not accepted` | the same under `live.kill` |
| `zmx.screen requires a daemon name` | `live.screen requires a daemon name` |
| `zmx.reset requires --force`, `… requires Live sessions mode both configured and active for this launch`, `… could not read the live session list`, `… refused: the pane inventory is incomplete`, `… found no live session to reset` | the same under `live.reset` (and `live.reset is not supported on this platform`, the build's own) |
| `zmx.present requires a session` | `live.present requires a session` |
| `zmx.attach requires a host`, `zmx.attach requires a remote session` | the same under `live.attach` |
| `zmx is unavailable in this instance` | `live sessions are unavailable in this instance` |
| `could not read the zmx session list` | `could not read the live session list` |
| `could not re-read the zmx session list before pruning` | `could not re-read the live session list before pruning` |
| `could not read the zmx screen of NAME` | `could not read the live session screen of NAME` |
| `NAME did not confirm the kill; zmx cleaned up a stale socket and the daemon may still be running` | `… the session host cleaned up a stale socket …` |
| `the pane's zmx daemon did not accept the input` | `the pane's live session did not accept the input` |
| `the remote agterm is too old to report its zmx endpoint` | `… its live-session endpoint` |
| `the zmx executable path is not absolute`, `the zmx executable is unavailable` (`restore.mode`'s `unavailableReason`) | `the live-session executable path is not absolute`, `the live-session executable is unavailable` |
| `this pane has no zmx daemon; run it in a main or split pane started under Live sessions` (`clipboard set`) | `this pane has no live session; run it in a main or split pane started under Live sessions` |
| `no zmx next to this agtermctl[; looked for PATH]`, `zmx print exited N: …` (`clipboard set`) | `no live-session executable next to this ngtermctl[; looked for PATH]`, `the live-session print exited N: …` |

The help texts of `ngtermctl live` and `restore mode` speak of live-session daemons and the session host the same way.

The session server (`ngterm-session`) takes zmx's place with names of its own, which no control-protocol field or
error string carries: `bin/ngterm-session` and `share/ngterm/session-BUILD` in the stage (upstream's bundled zmx and
its build stamp), `NGTERM_SESSION_PATH` (upstream's `AGTERM_ZMX_PATH`), the `session-build.json` record in the state
dir (`zmx-build.json`), the namespace `/tmp/ngterm-live-<hash>` (`/tmp/agterm-zmx-<hash>`), its attach contract's
`ngterm-session attach` line and `NGTERM_LIVE_*` variables (zmx's `ZMX_*`), and the role title `ngterm-live-role;`
(the patched zmx's `zmx-role;`). ngterm's own panes attach to their sessions in process through the server's client
library, so no attach client runs under the app (upstream's live panes run `zmx attach` in their PTYs); the remote
path and a terminal outside the app run the attach line. `clipboard set` prints through `ngterm-session print`, so its texts are the table's
above with the print's own complaint after `the live-session print exited N: ` (the session gone, or no server:
`ngterm-session print: no live session named NAME`) where upstream shows zmx's.

The suite's tests, `catalog.yaml` and their `covers(...)` markers keep upstream's names, since the Swift reference
answers to them; no test id changes, so the ratchet keeps its ids. Each adapter carries a vocabulary object
(`agterm_conformance/vocabulary.py`) for every value that depends on it: command names, the result and tree keys, the
CLI argv, the error-text templates, the environment names, the socket directory and the leading client. The Swift
adapter's is upstream's own (`UPSTREAM`), the Rust adapter's renames the group (`LIVE`); `base.py`, `cli_format.py`
and the shared tests read every such value through `ctl.vocabulary`, `cli.vocabulary` or the instance's. `LIVE`
refuses an upstream text that names zmx and that it does not list, and `selftests/test_vocabulary.py` checks each
listed text against the Rust sources.

The bundled agent skill (`resources/skills/ngterm`) is upstream's with
`build/patches/skill-ngterm/` applied (the `live` names, this build's `ngterm` and `ngtermctl`, then the attach
contract's `AGTERM_LIVE_*`, then the rest of this build's identity, `NGTERM_*` among it, then the restore adapter, then
`show-image.sh` passing the pane's socket):
`.claude/skills/agterm-upstream-sync/scripts/sync-resources.sh` rebuilds it as the new upstream tree plus those
patches on every sync, and `sync-resources.sh --check TAG TAG` with the pinned tag verifies the copy still equals it.

## Ratchet

`conformance/tools/run-linux.sh` builds the workspace (release), stages it with `scripts/stage.sh` and runs the
protocol, cli and behaviors layers with `--impl rust`, each instance on its own headless weston and session bus.
pytest writes each test's merged outcome with `--nodeid-report` next to the report in
`conformance/reports/rust-linux/`, and `conformance/tools/check_ratchet.py` holds `conformance/rust-passing.txt`
against it: one pytest node id per line, verbatim and sorted.
A listed id that fails, errors (a teardown error included) or skips breaks the run, except an `unsupported` skip
for a host-dependent capability (`live-sessions`, `live-any-shell`), which counts as not run.
A collection error or a `--must-pass` problem breaks it too.
When pytest refuses its arguments (a mistyped path after `--`) no report is written and the checker exits 2.
The checker prints the newly passing ids not yet listed; `--add` writes them into the list.
The report's run header names its mode: `full`; `ratchet-only` (`run-linux.sh --ratchet-only`, the listed ids
plus a task's `--also`/`--also-k` selections), judged like a full run, a listed id not collected warned about; or
`partial` (any narrower selection), where only the listed ids that ran are judged. No mode removes an id.
A change's local check is a partial run over the ids that cover what it touches; the full suite runs in CI on every PR
and push to main (conformance/README.md > Rust runner and ratchet).
The script exits with the ratchet's status, or 1 when an instance root was left behind, whatever pytest's own status.

## GPUI build

The Rust build is the GPUI one since the switch (the GPUI plan's Task 34), which removed the GTK frontend: the binary
is `ngterm-gpui`'s `ngterm`, and `rust-passing.txt` holds it (the GPUI build's own ratchet, kept beside the GTK one
until the switch, was folded into it).

Build. The native inputs come first, each into its vendored prefix (README > Native dependencies):
`scripts/build-ghostty-vt.sh` (the patched libghostty-vt source, which `ngterm-ghostty-vt-sys`'s build script builds
with Zig, offline, and Ghostty's resources at `LIBGHOSTTY_VT_REV`) and `scripts/fetch-fonts.sh` (the fonts the
terminal embeds); the live sessions' server, `ngterm-session`, is a workspace binary. `run-linux.sh` then builds
the release workspace without what links WPE WebKit and `ngterm-gpui` with its default `html` feature, so the staged
app shows HTML overlays and needs a WPE WebKit (README > WPE WebKit; the CI's is Arch's `wpewebkit`). `--stage DIR`
runs a tree staged elsewhere instead.

Staging. `scripts/stage.sh` assembles the tree the harness launches, `target/conformance-stage` by default:
`bin/ngterm`, `bin/ngtermctl` (the harness takes it from beside `--bin`; upstream's CLI is `agtermctl`,
and the CLI tests expect the adapter's name in usage lines) and `bin/ngterm-session` with
`share/ngterm/session-BUILD` (the staged server's build id), Ghostty's `share/terminfo` (`xterm-ghostty`) and
`share/ghostty` (themes, shell integration) from the libghostty-vt prefix, and the agent integrations' payloads under `share/ngterm` (this build's own name, not upstream's `share/agterm`).
There is no `lib/`: libghostty-vt is linked statically, and nothing of GTK,
libghostty or layer-shell is linked at all.

Lavapipe. GPUI renders through Vulkan (wgpu), so every run renders on Mesa's lavapipe, from
`scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh`: `NGTERM_LAVAPIPE_ICD` when set; the distribution's package where one is installed
(Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, Arch `vulkan-swrast`; the CI's source); else, on a rootless host with an
Arch-compatible userland, the pinned Arch `vulkan-swrast` package (`LAVAPIPE_*` in `build/pins.env`), checked against
its sha256 and unpacked into `${NGTERM_VENDOR}/lavapipe-<key>/`, refused where its libraries (libLLVM, glibc) do not
resolve. `run-linux.sh` exits 2 without one and hands its manifest to the harness, which makes it the only Vulkan
driver of every launch (Launch contract above). No lavapipe is an error, never a fallback to a hardware driver.
`ngterm-gpui`'s process tests take the same manifest from the same script (`tests/support/lavapipe.rs`).

Seat. GPUI needs a `wl_seat`, which a headless weston offers only with `--fake-seat` (weston 15.0 and later):
`run-linux.sh` takes the system's weston when it has the flag, else the one `scripts/build-weston.sh` built into
its vendored prefix (`WESTON_*` in `build/pins.env`; Ubuntu 26.04's is 14), and stops naming that script when there is
neither.

Probes. Three scripts beside the runner check what the suite cannot see, on the stage a run left (their `--bin`
default; CI runs them after the bash leg): `ghostty_probe.py` (a terminal draws its first frame), `webkit_probe.py`
(a page loads in WPE WebKit's sandbox) and `chrome_probe.py` (the title bar, the sidebar and the terminal draw the
theme's background, the sidebar tint washing the sidebar alone).
