# agterm conformance suite

Black-box tests that define feature parity with upstream agterm.
The same tests run against the released macOS app and the Rust build, over the control socket,
`agtermctl` and the accessibility tree.

## Install

```sh
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e conformance          # Linux, CI gate
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e "conformance[ax]"    # macOS: adds the ax ui driver's pyobjc
```

## Running

`--impl` picks the adapter; `--bin` is the app to launch; `--ctl` overrides the CLI found
beside it (`agtermctl`, the Rust build's `ngtermctl`: the adapter's `ctl_name`).

```sh
# upstream macOS release (a bundle or its executable); fetch_reference.py downloads and caches it by tag
bundle=$(.venv/bin/python conformance/tools/fetch_reference.py --tag v0.38.1 | sed -n 's/^bundle=//p')
.venv/bin/python -m pytest conformance/tests --impl swift-macos --bin "$bundle"

# the Rust build; without --bin every test skips and parity reads 0%
.venv/bin/python -m pytest conformance/tests --impl rust --bin <rust-binary>

# the Rust build of this checkout: build, stage, protocol, cli and behaviors, then the ratchet;
# report in conformance/reports/rust-linux/
conformance/tools/run-linux.sh [--stage DIR] [-- PYTEST_ARGS...]

# whether the staged Rust build's WPE WebKit loads a page under the same headless isolation (a diagnosis of the web
# process's bubblewrap sandbox; the report carries the frame mode from the app's log)
.venv/bin/python conformance/tools/webkit_probe.py [--bin PATH]

# whether the staged Rust build's terminal surface is created and draws a frame under the same isolation (`version`
# alone answers while the terminal cannot render); defaults to run-linux.sh's stage
.venv/bin/python conformance/tools/ghostty_probe.py [--bin PATH]

# whether the staged Rust build's title bar, sidebar and terminal draw one color, the terminal theme's background, and
# a sidebar tint washes the sidebar alone: screenshots of the maximized window from the same isolation, its weston
# started with --debug for weston-screenshooter (a Rust-build check outside the catalog); defaults to the same stage
.venv/bin/python conformance/tools/chrome_probe.py [--bin PATH] [--keep DIR]
```

`--macos-launch-mode plain` replaces the default `uitest` launch (XCUITest sentinel with zmx on).
The Rust build renders on lavapipe only (see Rust runner and ratchet): its probes and the harness take the ICD manifest
from `$CONFORMANCE_LAVAPIPE_ICD`, the probes else from `scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh --print-icd`.
The Rust build's side of the contract (the `version` extension, the launch environment, the capability
vocabulary) is in [docs/rust-build.md](docs/rust-build.md).

## Layers

- `tests/protocol`: one JSON line per request over the socket, through `ctl`.
- `tests/cli`: `agtermctl` output, exit codes and socket resolution, through `cli`.
- `tests/behaviors`: relaunch, keymap and hooks, across instances started by `launch`.
- `tests/ui`: accessibility ids from `ui-ids.yaml`, through `ui`.
  Only the macOS `ax` driver exists; elsewhere the layer skips as unsupported.
- `selftests`: the harness itself, host-free; they run without `--impl`.

## Markers

- `since("0.38.1")`: skipped as `not-yet-at-level` when the build's parity level is lower.
- `requires("capability", reason=...)`: skipped as `unsupported` when the build lacks it.
  A test that branches instead asks `adapter.has("capability")`.
  Both refuse names outside the vocabulary in `impls/base.py`.
- `covers("item", ..., streams=(...))`: the catalog keys a test covers; a stream-mode command counts only when
  `streams` names it too, from a test that drives the stream after the ok.

The run summary prints pass, fail, both skip kinds and reruns, and parity: passed over passed, failed and
not-yet-at-level, so an unsupported capability is a recorded divergence, not a gap.

- `--must-pass CAPABILITY` fails the run unless every collected test requiring it ran and passed, and at least one
  did (reference-macos uses it for `live-sessions`).
- `--nodeid-report PATH` writes one JSON line per run test with its outcome merged over setup, call and teardown,
  plus the run's collection errors and `--must-pass` problems; `tools/check_ratchet.py` reads it.
  A run pytest refuses (a usage error, a path or node id that matches nothing) or that breaks internally writes none.
- `--reruns N` (pytest-rerunfailures) is for the ui layer only, where accessibility reads race the app.
  Protocol, cli and behaviors tests wait on read-back and never rerun.

## Reference discipline

The reference is upstream's macOS release: a test is accepted only when it is green on reference-macos in CI.
Red on the reference means the test is wrong.

Where the Rust build legitimately differs from the reference on observable state or effects (a platform divergence,
such as Wayland giving a client no window position), the divergence becomes a capability with a reason, and the test
asserts each branch under `requires` or `adapter.has`. Everything else asserts upstream's behavior and upstream's
full error text directly.

The Rust build is held to upstream's contract, its capability branches included: it claims the capabilities listed
in [docs/rust-build.md](docs/rust-build.md) > Rust target profile, and where a test branches on a capability it
takes upstream's branch unless that list says otherwise.
The Rust build's progress is held by a ratchet: `conformance/rust-passing.txt` lists the ids that went green, and
`run-linux.sh` fails when one of them goes red again (see rust-build.md > Ratchet).
A Rust-only extension (today `live-any-shell`, Live sessions in bash, fish and PowerShell login shells) is a
capability the reference does not claim: its tests skip as unsupported there and are validated by the Rust CI with
`--must-pass` on the capability (see rust-build.md > Rust-only extensions).

## Rust runner and ratchet

`tools/run-linux.sh` builds the workspace (release), stages it with `scripts/stage.sh` into
`target/conformance-stage` (or runs an existing stage given with `--stage DIR`) and runs the protocol, cli and
behaviors layers with `--impl rust`, each instance on its own headless weston and session bus (Safety guards).
It runs pytest with `$PYTHON`, else `.venv/bin/python`, else `python3`, with this checkout's harness first on
`PYTHONPATH`.
Into `--out DIR` (default `reports/rust-linux/`) it writes `report.md`, `junit.xml`, `pytest.log` and `nodeids.jsonl`,
the `--nodeid-report`.
It exits with the ratchet's status, not pytest's, since red tests are expected until parity: 0 holds, 1 broken (or an
instance root left behind), 2 no usable report.
One suite run at a time per user: concurrent runs, from any checkout, queue on `$CONFORMANCE_LOCK` (default
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agterm-conformance.lock`, else `/tmp/agterm-conformance-<uid>/`), and a waiting run says so; the
deadlines assume one suite's load, and the lock does not hold back a stand-alone `cargo build` or `cargo test`.

```sh
conformance/tools/run-linux.sh                          # full run
conformance/tools/run-linux.sh -- -k test_version       # partial run: listed ids not selected are not judged
.venv/bin/python conformance/tools/check_ratchet.py \
  --report conformance/reports/rust-linux/nodeids.jsonl --add  # merge the newly green ids into rust-passing.txt
conformance/tools/run-linux.sh --ratchet-only \
  --also tests/protocol/test_split.py --also-k sidebar       # the listed ids plus what a task works on
```

The build is the GPUI one (`bin/ngterm`; the GTK frontend, and the GPUI ratchet kept beside its own while both
coexisted, went with the plan's Task 34, the GPUI list folded into `rust-passing.txt`).
It renders through Vulkan, here on Mesa's lavapipe and nothing else: the runner takes its ICD manifest
from `scripts/fetch-lavapipe.sh` (`NGTERM_LAVAPIPE_ICD`, else the distribution's package, else the pinned Arch package
verified and unpacked into the vendor dir) and hands it to the harness as `CONFORMANCE_LAVAPIPE_ICD`; without one the
run exits 2.
The adapter makes it the instance's only Vulkan driver (`VK_DRIVER_FILES`), forces GL onto llvmpipe, drops every
inherited device selection, refuses a manifest that does not load lavapipe, and starts the instance's weston with
`--fake-seat` (GPUI panics on a compositor without a `wl_seat`).
`--fake-seat` needs weston 15.0 or later: where the weston on PATH lacks it (Ubuntu 26.04 ships 14), the runner takes
the one `scripts/build-weston.sh` vendors, else exits 2 naming that script, and the adapter refuses such a weston with
the same pointer. The ICD manifest must name a driver that is there.

`rust-passing.txt` holds one pytest node id per line, verbatim (an id may end in spaces) and sorted, after its `#`
header.
`check_ratchet.py` prints the breaks and the newly passing ids (into the job summary in CI); `--add` writes only when
the ratchet holds, and never removes an id.
What breaks it is listed in [docs/rust-build.md](docs/rust-build.md) > Ratchet.

A full run waits out the read-back of every red test (a GPUI run short of parity: ~47 min, almost all of it in tests
that cannot pass yet), so `--ratchet-only` runs just the ids the list holds, plus each
`--also` directory, file or node-id prefix (a path outside the protocol, cli and behaviors layers is collected too)
and each `--also-k` `-k` expression, repeatable: a task names what it is working on.
An `--also` or `--also-k` that matches no collected test is a usage error (exit 2), unless `-k`, `-m` or node ids
narrowed the run. The plugin options behind it are `--ratchet-only LIST`, `--also` and `--also-k`. The nodeid report's run header then says `"mode": "ratchet-only"`, and
`check_ratchet.py` judges it as a full run: every listed id must pass, a listed id that was not collected is warned
about, and `--add` adds only ids that ran and passed. A narrower selection (`-k`, `-m` or node ids after `--`) makes
the mode `partial`: the listed ids that did not run are not judged, so a partial run can neither break nor shrink
the list through what it left out. The report names the mode and the suite time.
A full run stays the default and is required at milestones (the GPUI switch, the plan's Task 34, was one), and whenever a
change touches the harness or shared crates broadly (ngterm-core, -proto, -host, -server, -ctl, -session, -app or
-term). Between them a task's routine run is ratchet-only; it finds newly passing ids only among its `--also`
selections, so a task that turns on a broad area (the terminal, say) grows the list with a full run.
`--nodeid-report` cannot be combined with `--coverage-gate`.

## Catalog and coverage gate

`catalog.yaml` (commands, fields, events, CLI subcommands, behaviors, exemptions) and `ui-ids.yaml` are generated
from an upstream tag:

```sh
.venv/bin/python conformance/tools/gen_catalog.py --tag v0.37.0 --repo ../agterm   # or --source <extracted tree>
```

Generated sections are replaced and statuses survive; `behaviors` and `exemptions` are hand-maintained.
Retire an item with `status: removed-upstream`.

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest conformance --coverage-gate
```

The gate launches nothing.
It fails on any active item that no `covers` names and no exemption with a reason excuses, and on a `covers` of an
unknown or removed item.
`covered`/`uncovered` statuses are informational.

## Safety guards

These runs share a machine with a live terminal (an installed ngterm, or an agterm), so the harness refuses a launch
that could reach it:

- `NGTERM_*`, `AGTERM_*` and `ZMX_*` are scrubbed from the environment at plugin import, and the launch env may carry
  only the harness's own.
- Each instance gets a fresh root (`/tmp/agt-*`, or under `CONFORMANCE_TMP`) holding its `HOME`, XDG homes, state
  dir and socket; the guards refuse any of them outside it.
  Its live-session socket directory (upstream's zmx one, the Rust build's session server namespace) derives
  from that state dir.
- Linux instances get a unique app id (`NGTERM_APP_ID`), never the installed one, and a private `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
- Linux instances draw into their own headless weston with their own dbus-daemon, so no window, notification or
  a11y object reaches the desktop.
  The harness requires both programs.
  `CONFORMANCE_LINUX_DISPLAY=session` uses the desktop's display and bus instead, for debugging only.
- A GPUI instance renders on lavapipe only, in either display mode: never on the machine's GPU driver.
- URI and file launches go to a no-op handler through the isolated `mimeapps.list` and `BROWSER=true`.
  The ghostty config turns off copy-on-select and clipboard writes.
- `cli` gives every `agtermctl` call the instance's `--socket`; a call without one must resolve under the root.
- Stopping reaps Live daemons over the protocol (in the adapter's vocabulary: `zmx.kill` upstream, `live.kill` in the
  Rust build, [docs/rust-build.md](docs/rust-build.md)), SIGTERMs only the launched pid, and fails on any zmx or
  session-host process left with the instance's `ZMX_DIR`, or in the Rust build on its session server
  (`ngterm-session server <its namespace>`) or a process left with its `NGTERM_LIVE_DIR`, once the server's idle grace
  has passed.
  The macOS session host outlives the app by design: the harness ends only the one started from the instance's own
  bundle copy, by exact pid, re-checking ownership before each signal.
- A macOS instance runs from its own copy of the bundle, because a second launch of the same bundle path binds no
  socket ([docs/spike-macos.md](docs/spike-macos.md)).
- `CFFIXED_USER_HOME` does not isolate the `com.umputun.agterm` defaults domain, which every macOS instance shares
  with the account.
  Run reference-macos only on an ephemeral runner, never on a Mac with a live agterm.

## CI

- `conformance-gate` (ubuntu): self-tests and the coverage gate on every PR and on `main`.
- `reference-macos` (`macos-26`): protocol, cli and behaviors with `--must-pass live-sessions`, then the ui layer
  with `--reruns 1`, against the release named by the catalog's `upstream`.
- `rust-linux` (`ubuntu-26.04`): the Rust workspace's format check, strict clippy, lint report (in the job summary)
  and `cargo test`, over the vendored libghostty-vt prefix, without what links WPE WebKit; `wpe` (an Arch container):
  the WPE crates and the app with its HTML overlays; then the staged build under the suite in the same Arch container,
  on the distribution's lavapipe, held by the ratchet, once per login shell (`conformance`, a matrix), each with
  `--must-pass live-any-shell`: bash, fish and zsh (with `--must-pass live-sessions` too).
