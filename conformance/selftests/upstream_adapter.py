"""A self-test double: the base `Adapter` as a Linux desktop launch in upstream's vocabulary.

It runs the machinery the real adapters share (the isolation guards, the launch env, the headless weston and bus, the
socket wait, the stop and the leftover check) with upstream's `AGTERM_` variables, `agtermctl` and its vocabulary
(`swift_macos.UPSTREAM`), which swift_macos.py speaks, on the Linux host the self-tests run on. No implementation stands behind it; `RustAdapter` is
the Rust build's Linux launch with its own vocabulary.
